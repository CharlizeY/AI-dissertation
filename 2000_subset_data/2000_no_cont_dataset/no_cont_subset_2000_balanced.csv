alice-baber_abstract-composition-1969-1,amusement,"The colors and shapes are happy.It's a really playful color scheme and very light, almost watercolor.The bright color palette combined with the fun shapes make this painting lively. it makes me smile."
andy-warhol_oxidation-painting-1978-1,disgust,The colors are depressing and the shapes on the right side look like slime in a scary movie.Looks like somebody pooped on this painting.The shapes resemble some sort of bacteria i could observe under a microscope.
atsuko-tanaka_untitled-1976,disgust,"Looks like a child colored with a lot of different paint in circular shapes, not appealing.Looks like another mess i have to clean up.The colors and shapes have no pattern and a lot of overlap."
clyfford-still_1947-h-no-3-1947,fear,The color palette and art style. the lower-right corner looks like an attacking bear or wolf.The dark areas of paint look violent and remind me of a dark forest.The colors and strokes make it look like a scary fire.
craig-kauffman_still-life-1957,something else,"I don't know what this is about, don't like the colors very confusing.I dont know what this is, its hard to have feeling for it. its too confusing for me.Inquisitive, i think it looks like power lines on fire but it could be interpreted many ways."
david-smith_untitled-1961,something else,"I feel confused as i do not know what this is.Boredom-seems like a bland piece of metal, i don't see the symbolism.Inspired. i like this sculpture, very linear and well put together."
edward-corbett_untitled-1950,fear,It seems dark and gloomy.It is very dark and gloomy. im afraid of the dark.The painting looks very scary.Not clear what is happening in this dark painting. could easily be something scary.The darkness is consuming.The painting is extremely dark and makes you wonder what is hiding in the darkness.This looks like a dark scene with a mysterious deep.It feels like i am walking into an attic that is hiding dark demons within.
elaine-de-kooning_bacchus-3-1978,something else,"I can't tell if this is a statue of a human or tree.This is an odd picture, not sure what is going on.Confusion- have no idea what this is."
esteban-vicente_untitled-8-1997,excitement,"The colors are very vibrant and bold.The bright colors, especially the yellow, is exciting.All the bright yellow and green is like sunlight streaming into the forest excitement of life in myriad forms."
forrest-bess_night-flight-1959,fear,The white spots make me feel there is something in the dark watching me.Makes me feel like there are eyes in the night watching me.Walking in a pitch black forest and these eyes just come out of nowhere.
forrest-bess_spots-1967,amusement,Somewhat amused as it seems like a little child's painting with bright colors but the dark lines spoil the painting.I like that hole up top. then there red and blue dots. i'm just amused by the lack of structure and clear subject of this work.The blue and red balls are fun and remind me of a clown or circus.
frank-bowling_37528-2008,fear,"It looks like the artist drew a rainbow, and then scratched it out in anger with a brillo pad.The red in the painting looks like blood drops for some reason.Yellow sickness slowly encroaches on the other print."
geta-bratescu_the-rule-of-the-circle-the-rule-of-the-game-1985(6),something else,"The scrap look around the edges of the circle makes me want to see the rest filled.This piece looks unfinished, and sloppy, it looks as if someone just threw down pieces of paper or cloth, but they didn't finish.I feel confusion, this picture reminds me of a washing machine window while clothes are washing."
geta-bratescu_the-rule-of-the-circle-the-rule-of-the-game-1985(8),something else,"This makes me think someone didn't finish their project in a geometry class and it is so mathematical and causes me anxiety. i cant even look at it.The image is confusing, as i am not really certain of it's purpose or what the differing colors and patterns might represent.Anxiety.  it's an incomplete circle that's missing a chunk."
hans-hofmann_delirious-pink-1961,something else,"There is probably more to this than i can see but to me this just looks like paint smears.  it is unimpressive.The painting looks like someone was just trying out different colors on the canvas.Pink always brings the sadness out, in me.This is very simple and boring. it looks like a four year old could do it by painting a few strokes."
hans-hofmann_the-bouquet-1959,disgust,"The colors blend together to make a nasty brown color which makes me think of diarrhea.The mixing of the colors make a gross looking brown color.The mix of colors, and erratic way it is mixed together, makes me go yuck!The colors together are ugly. i hate this type of art. i don't see anything at all that makes any sense whatsoever, and i wouldn't want to stare at it too long because i find it ugly."
hans-hofmann_the-conjurer-1959,something else,This makes me confused not sure what this represents.I can say the colors are bright and make bold statement but for what purpose is unsure.I am confused by the figure on the right side that looks like a man with a distorted left arm.
helen-frankenthaler_tuscany-1963,fear,The brown line at the bottom looks like a childs chocolate mouth.The main subject in the painting looks like a monster with it's mouth open eating something.The main subject in the painting looks like monster with it's mouth open.
howard-hodgkin_all-alone-in-the-museum-of-art-1979,fear,"The dark colors looks scary and brings up fear as my first emotion.The darkness makes me fearful.The composition of the piece is confusing, dark, and otherwise feels like it might be hiding something.The dark coloring and pencl like drawing makes me feel sadd and like mad thigns are about to happen."
jack-bush_yellow-flower-1958,excitement,Gorgeous green yin and yang. so good!The high contrast of the colors and lack of any form is exciting.The combination between a drawing and painting look is especially fond to view.
jack-tworkov_thursday-1960,anger,"The lines resemble a prison cell made out of blood.This makes me feel a little aggressive. the red strokes signify blood or hate, and the black signifies death. the way they are combined is very primitive, as if full of toxicity.The red cuts through the black like scratches or scars in what feels like a fit of rage."
jack-tworkov_untitled-1955,anger,"This looks like something i would paint, rage in sharp brush strokes on a calming cream canvas.The strokes seem hurried and brash which creates an energy that feels negative.Anger management as a painting or an attempt to write in chinese.  visually, it makes me confused and upset.The scattered shapes and lines make are erratic and make me feel odd."
jackson-pollock_portrait-and-a-dream-1953,anger,"The blackness makes me angry because it seems incomplete.The face on the right seems finished, but the object on the left doesn't in comparison.  nor do i really see how the two sides are connected.The placement and color of the lines have a very aggressive feel."
jean-paul-riopelle_conversation-1946,fear,"The black figures looks like evil spirits.The black lines look scary, intense and aggressive.The black looks like nettles growing on a beach.There is so much confusion in this work.  the colors and the lines seem almost frantic."
jean-paul-riopelle_pavane-1954,fear,"The darkness at the bottom of the central panel reminds one of a mysterious, oppressive abyss.The chaos of the colors gives me a very unnerving feeling. the sharp contrast of colors makes me feel fear and anxiety.This made me think of the amount of plastic in our ocean."
joan-mitchell_untitled-1964,something else,"The color blue is too much compared to the other colors of red, white and yellow.This just looks like a mess.  nothing really stands out to me.  i'd look at this painting and never look at it again.A mass of colorful confusion makes me feel annoyed and stressed out by this painting."
joan-mitchell_untitled-1964(1),disgust,"This image lacks coherent structure or purpose and looks like a mess of accidental colors splashed on top of each other.I dont like it, it just looks like a blob of brush strokes.It looks too disorganized and random."
joan-mitchell_untitled-1973,amusement,"The combination of colors and playfulness of the image.I like the contrast of the warm yellow/orange/red colors with the cool blue. reminds me of the beach on a summer day.Though i am not a fan of watercolor, i do like how the artist achieves solidity in the subjects.  i can see the hair, scarves, skirts, and shoes without the annoying wishy-washy watercolor effect.  i like the way the background keeps the eyes moving, but wish the shoes could be grounded on something--they look like they are levitating.  if they are levitating, there should be action lines to denote this, but these are not visible."
joe-goode_untitled-torn-clouds-1974,something else,Cloudy skies with two streaks of white in the middle. it seems dreamy and mysterioys.It makes me wonder if a large beast scratched this glass.Look like it could be sperm cells amongst clouds in the sky showing our dna is everywhere.
john-mccracken_mandala-i-1972,excitement,The multiple colours looks like a target pad.I love the bold defined color blocking. rainbows are so joyful.Looks like a dart board. makes me want to play darts.
louise-nevelson_night-presence-ii-1976,something else,"This piece resembles some sort of reconstructed but functionless furniture, leaving me a bit confused.This feels so out of contxt in this location. non-sensical.There is a weird wall-like sculpture made out of wood, is an abstract piece and looks like is inside of a building."
mark-tobey_after-the-harvest-1970,something else,"The color. the way the lines are being used.I feel joy from this painting. the lines are very botanical and expressive of a jungle. the green has enough variation to bring the piece to life, especially with the white highlights.It looks like the close up of a leaf - the patterns are intricate and interesting."
milton-resnick_bruno-1982,something else,Dark looking and not very appealing to look at.A mysterious look of grays and opaque whites in a simple piece of artwork.I guess i should have brought my umbrella after all.This looks like a piece of slate so i dont feel anything since there is nothing other than grey to look at.
milton-resnick_composition-1963,something else,"I like that the closer you look the more detail and colors can be found.A nice use of color with the reds, yellow and greens but a little bland.Canvas comp,etely covered with olive green color and tiny embellishes of orange and brown. its staid and a little dull."
milton-resnick_dark-forest-1975,something else,It makes me feell tense.  the patterns make me think of static.I feel nothing but confusion since it is just a black textured photo.I feel confused because it's just a black photo that's textured.Bored. it looks like a stone surface maybe granite or rock. there is nothing to catch my attention.
paul-jenkins_not_detected_235722,awe,Even though i don't know what it is but i like the strokes of colors it has.The deep bold colors have so much depth and beauty.The white dots on the painting make me want to guess what this is.
perle-fine_the-roaring-wind-1958,something else,"An interesting picture if this is the type of art you prefer. the gold, black and white tones are calming.I look to this is see myself feeling confused as to what is happening. i like because of the shapes and the coloring. it looks like it can be anything, that confuses me on feelings.The colors are interesting as the beige contrasts with the white and grey."
rafa-nasiri_untitled-028-1981,something else,It looks like a possible religious site but it's also too unclear to making definitive judgments.Abstract painting with a matte red colored box and beige stone steps on a black canvas.The large building on the bottom remind me of ancient buildings but they remind me of dark times due to the black sky.
richard-diebenkorn_albuquerque-no-11,disgust,"I don't like abstract art. i could stare at a dirty shower and see the same thing.The ripped and falling textures look like peeling flesh.It looks like a run down house that's been abandoned, like the walls. gross."
richard-pousette-dart_celebration-birth-1976,awe,This picture is busy yet calming.A field of daisies are growing wild in the heat of the city.All of the little dots make this very interesting to look at.Love the colors and the small dots that make it look like some reef in the ocean.
richard-pousette-dart_white-gothic-no-5-1961,something else,"The lines in this painting represent confusion to me. you can almost make some shapes/object out and then the lines change and you can't.Dont like this at all, its too messy and looks like a childs crayon drawings.The picture is a bit distracting as it kinda hurts my eyes a bit."
robert-nickle_b5-1964,something else,"This is a simple gray painting, but the design isn't simple at all.I feel like i am looking at a stone floor and that's it. it has nothing in this photo that makes me feel any emotion.This painting reminds me of a depressing grey sky patchwork quit."
ronnie-landfield_untitled-1969,excitement,"The streaks of white, yellow  and red look like fireworks.Fireworks bright enough to streak the sky at sunset.The bright yellows and oranges and the curious streamers evoke the idea of fire, energy, and change.A burst of heat and energy in this beautiful painting of sunburst tones of yellow and mango orange."
salvador-dali_arabs,disgust,"It just looks like curdled milk; so gross and nauseating looking.The jumbled, twisted shapes of the picture do not depict anything clearly, but somewhat evoke the idea of rotten food or filth thanks to their putrid colors and shapes.Interesting texture but it looks like squeezed toothpaste noodles covered in mustard vomit."
salvador-dali_faciamus-hominem-genesis-1-26-1964,disgust,"This person has some very dirty feet and perhaps some fungal issues.  he also appears to be missing an eye, not a very attractive painting.No one understands why he woud bring this back to everyone's memory, we want it gone.The large foot and man's face are gross looking.The figure in the middle reminds me of afterbirth.It looks like a big pile of poop and it makes me feel nauseous to look at it.The painting is nothing more than a blob and a foot making me feel disgusted."
salvador-dali_religious-scene-in-particles,fear,The subject on the left hand side looks like a demon emerging from the shadows.The tiny dark spots look like a ton of blood spatter.It feels like a scary clash between dark forces such as bats versus other birds in the white.
sam-francis_eye-of-zengai-1964,something else,"This border is a blue, black, red and yellow splash of paint on a white background.The dribbles of color evoke no emotion in me.This painting seem chaotic and makes me feel uneasy inside."
sam-francis_flash-point(1),disgust,"It looks like a bloodstain around a light switch, with growths of black mildew - gross.It almost looks like an overhead shot of a sink, full of blood and gory bits from a recent slaughter.This looks like a plate of human blood which is gross."
sam-francis_sulfur-sails-1969,excitement,"The painting uses geometry and shape to convey infinite possibilities.Could be used for party invite, with it's splattered colors.The white center of the painting provides a contrast to the assortment of colors that act as a border for the piece.  it suggests potential to a viewer.It looks like a celebration and like it is a border for a fun message."
sam-francis_untitled-1947,something else,I am confused.  i like the soft colors in the picture but have no real focal point or idea what is happening.A faded image of various different objects makes this painting filled with wonder and excitement.Nothing - the painting color palette  is dull and un-inventive.
sam-francis_untitled-1990,excitement,The mix of colors is exciting and some give a motion feeling. a smear here and there adds dimension.The free spirit of the splattering coupled with the rainbow colors are exciting.The splatter of red green and blue complement each other and the horizontal and diagonal lines suggest movement.
sam-francis_untitled-1990-1,amusement,"The watercolors are bright and contrasting and give a sense of motion.I love all of the bright colors, but this picture looks like an organized mess.Reds, yellows, blacks and blues  dance across the canvas in this piece i can see shapes in the piece that almost look like colorful animals.The shapes look like pipes and people."
sam-francis_untitled-sf-236-1978,disgust,"This looks like fabric design for generic boardshorts from the eighties.Another abstract expressionist rehashing the ideas of jackson pollock, annoying.This looks like a knit blanket that has gotten completely dirty."
sam-francis_untitled-sf76-176-1976,fear,Fear that something bad happened with what appears to be blood splatters and pools.The splatters look like a pool of blood.This looks like blood which make me fear that something is wrong or someone is hurt.
sam-gilliam_st-albans-1976,something else,"The painting is boring and it comes off as a bunch of random colorful lines.It feels likealot going on kind of a crazy moment.Very busy picture, colors are soft but annoying."
terry-frost_leeds-landscape-1956,something else,The gray likes shades make the picture look boring.I don't know what this image is of it is confusing.I dont feel like the lines mean anything.
terry-frost_winter-1956-yorkshire-1956,disgust,There's not a lot going on in this painting and the colors are very dull and bland.It looks like a closeup of a shirt that is dirty. not appealing to me.This is an ugly painting that looks like dirty curtains.
theodoros-stamos_edge-of-burning-brush-1986,something else,"Irritated - i really don't like this form of abstract although it does look like the coast of africa.The brush strokes look like there is a a lot going on in black.I am a bit confounded by this one, the red an blue likes remind me of the ""hair"" present in paper currency, but as for the rest, i dont know what i can see in it."
theodoros-stamos_moon-garden-1946,something else,Looks like a mountain man trudging his way through the winter slosh.I am curious what i am looking at.  i don't know what it is or what what the artist was thinking.Lots of snow on the ground of an icy day in the country.
vasile-dobrian_hypostasis-1986,something else,"I don't really feel anything, because all i see is five minutes of work with no actual purpose. it kind of looks like a bookshelf.An abstract painting that looks like a billboard with all the type highlighted out. i just find it confusing and meaningless to me.It just seems like a child's painting, not sure what this is."
walasse-ting_morning-series-1974,excitement,Rainbow colors in a playful explosive pattern of joy.It looks like it is raining raindrops of pure color! the colors are exciting and bright. it reminds me of a rainstorm of joy.The artwork is very bright and active. it reminds me of candy.
willem-de-kooning_asheville(1),disgust,This looks like people marching to war with violence and weapons.The painting has lots of sharp and heavy black lines which look overbearing and don't harmonize with the other colors and shapes in the painting.I do not like the distortion of the shapes or the use of the dark colors.
willem-de-kooning_fire-island,disgust,"The various shapes barely resemble a bird, if anything at all.The white parts of the painting remind me of body parts.It is easy to see inappropriate-looking items in this painting."
willem-de-kooning_the-wave,disgust,"The painting looks like a group of random, uneven shapes with no meaning.A blue background with different spots and shapes in different colors, grey, mustard, black and red.The curved lines throughout the work contrast unpleasantly with the reddish orange square - the entire work is discordant and irksome, as if it were made by different artists who refused to communicate with each other."
willem-de-kooning_untitled-i,something else,"I believe someone just got some random colors and smeared them on some paper.Abstract conbination of colors, yellow, red, blue and green on a white background.The picture feels boring there are only colors and no story being told.Bored. i could make this blind and with one hand."
willem-de-kooning_untitled-v-1983,something else,"I feel confusion as all i see are random splotches of color. there is no shape or pattern that i can discern.Confusion, i don't know what is going on, colors are aggressive.Enticed.  the abstract contains sexual undercurrents.  specifically, the artist's use of imagery makes it seem as if feminine form is emerging from the yellow colors of the piece."
willem-de-kooning_untitled-woman,disgust,"Everything about the naked women is disgusting in this.The distortion of the figure takes away the human qualities and makes the figure look like a bag of meat. the use of red intensifies my repulsion and adds to the graphic nature of the image.This reminds me of the man known as sloth in the film se7en, one of the most grotesque scenes in movie history ever."
willem-de-kooning_woman-3,disgust,"It looks dirty, like the bottom of a trash can that needs to be washed.I don't know what this is, it's not interesting in an abstract way, the color is lacking, and makes me think of a leftover meat sandwich in the fridge.It looks like unseasoned chicken meat. the top looks like a chicken's organs."
william-congdon_piazza-san-marco-no-5-1958,sadness,"For some reason, this painting makes me think of a cemetery, or somewhere being caged in. it is very minimalist, so i could be getting the wrong impression. but the grey colors and lines leave me feeling like i am left alone in a lonely graveyard.This painting's white color is freezing cold. the greys are alomost suffocating.This looks lonely and unsafe because it seems like an isolated yard during winter and it has a wierd object in it that has cover over it. so it is a little creepy."
william-congdon_the-black-city-i-new-york-1949,something else,"Looks like a lone surviving robot rolling across a scorched earth.Confused not really any feeling of what the artist was going for.I feel nothing for this, it just looks like someone scratched up a wall and called it art."
franz-kline_mahoning-1956,anger,"The intensity of black colors reminds me of the ruins after a fire.The hard and thick black strokes against white makes the strokes look even rougher and more aggressive. gives me a feeling of anger.The brushstrokes appear harsh and haphazard, and the dark smeared black evokes hostility."
franz-kline_orange-outline-1955,something else,"The black lines and the shade of yellow doesn't make nothing.It makes no sense to me. i feel nothing when i look at this.The dark/light color interplay.I feel a sense of frustration, like there is a complicated ""knot"" of problems that are creating an internal struggle."
a.y.-jackson_nellie-lake-1933,excitement,The shapes used for the mountains suggest a lot of activity.I want to explore the valley.The scene depicted looks like a land with great adventure.
a.y.-jackson_wilderness-deese-bay,sadness,"It appears that there was a bad fire here that did a great deal of image.The scenery looks dead and barren.This instills a feeling of death and destruction, sadness and loss.It looks as if damage from fire of lava has occurred destroying natural beauty."
aladar-korosfoi-kriesch_memory-1905,sadness,I feel the sadness of the angel.The angel is crying.This painting makes me feel sad because it lacks color and does a very good job of portraying pain on the angel's face.Best brandy makes me feel sad for the angel who was being punished.
alexandre-benois_cover-page-1904(4),amusement,"I like the curious layering, like the people on the top of the hat.The cyrillic writing in this painting leads one to believe that some state-sponsored entertainment such as a play is being advertised.This picture has a happy holiday feel with the jewel tone colors of detailed people grouped together at the top and bottom."
alexandre-benois_peterhof-palace-mon-plaisir-medium-room(1),awe,"Wow, i would love to walk i to this room. the blues are calming and that ceiling is amzing. you want to go look out those windows and stand by that fireplace and look at the ceilings and paintings.The store work and ceiling of the building in the painting makes me feel amazed.A room with elegance."
alphonse-mucha_ruby,awe,"Shows a mixture of beauty with the flowers but also a sense of authority with the posture and facial features of the woman.I am extremely appreciative of the way femininity is depicted in this one, especially the position she is in and her body language. the way her head is thrown back, she definitely looks like a tough woman by nature.The red of the flower and her expresion brings so much power."
alphonse-mucha_salome-1897,excitement,"Lovely use of gradient colours and styles, love the line work.Bringing music, excitement and the element of dance to life.The woman looks lively and happy."
alphonse-mucha_studies-1902,something else,I feel anticipation because it looks like whatever food is in the serving dish will be delicious.I'm just confused because i just can't tell what i'm looking at.I feel observant because the image contains great detail and appears to depict objects accurately.
aubrey-beardsley_design-for-the-cover-of-the-barbarous-britishers-by-h-d-traill,something else,"This piece gives me an intruiging feeling.Intrigued. is it a book plate, with a cryptic set of intials of the book owner at the top? and what is being carried in the box by the maid? shoe-cleaning brushes? and why the question mark at the bottom? it's a puzzle.Spooky, almost like a strange tarot card."
aubrey-beardsley_lysistrata-defending-the-acropolis-1896,amusement,"It looks like these women are getting their revenge on an evil man who thought he was superior.Her farting towards the man is hilarious.This depicts a person farting , which is quite amusing.This is very juvenile but farting on a man to keep him away is funny."
aubrey-beardsley_the-woman-in-the-moon-1894,disgust,A large person is on their deathbed while people look on with aversion.The contradiction between the genitals and the person's face sounds disgusting to me.This photo makes me feel disgusted since there appears to be a man/woman with there genitalia showing and a weird face in the distance. it seems a bit gross and perverted for no apparent reason.
boris-kustodiev_a-merchant-in-a-fur-coat-1920,amusement,The big man looks funny.This man is so big! just have to smile.The man is comically fat and large.
boris-kustodiev_easter-greeting-1916,amusement,"Very colorful and sweet, like a cherry or rose.The expression in this mans eyes made me giggle a little.Love the dress and the shawl, wonder about the really tall cake on the table."
boris-kustodiev_meeting-easter-day-1917,amusement,"Love, joy and laughter is what i see while looking a group of people enjoying each other.I like the people's weird hats and fat faces, they look cheerful and it makes me smile.I feel amusement to see the laughter and social companionship the people felt together to just enjoy the day outside amongst cows and the community."
boris-kustodiev_moscow-tavern-1916,amusement,"It looks like a group of people enjoying themselves.It makes me laugh because i think it looks like a group on men who have been friends for a long time having dinner and enjoying each others company.At first glance the soldiers look forbidding, but the cat and the man lounging on the left give the impression that this is a relaxed meal.The outfit those people are wearing look odd and a little silly. also the guy with the mustache and tea pot made me laugh a little."
boris-kustodiev_palm-sunday-near-the-spassky-gate-on-the-red-square-in-moscow-1917,excitement,"Feels exciting; like you can feel the pulse of the event through the picture.The two columns of colorful balloons floating above the crowd shopping and milling reinforce the feeling of excitement.  lots to see and lots to do.Colorful balloons are flying.  many people are gathered, apparently in a celebratory mood."
carl-larsson_brita-and-me-1895(1),amusement,Both figures depicted look like they are having fun and the vibrant colors contribute to that.The little girl is adorable and looks like she’s having fun.The face on the little girl is infectious and sets the mood for the entire piece.The happy child is precariously balanced on the man's head.The jolly faces of the man and child suggest they are entertaining a room full of guests.
carl-larsson_christmas-morning-1894(1),amusement,"There are some many kids playing, each doing something different.  it is cheerful.Bedtime as mother supposes but the children have other ideas.What happens after the children are sent to bed.The expressions on the kids faces and their interest in their individual activities makes me feel like they're all satisfied and content with how things are going. the child on the bed looks like he's having a really exciting time playing based on his defiant standing on the bed and facial expression.The innocence of childhood is captured in every way."
carl-larsson_self-recognition-1906(1),amusement,This is a very interesting image to look at with the creepy looking clown and woman in the background window.The ruddiness of the guy's cheeks corresponds well with the doll's expression and odd smile.The little goofy looking doll in this serious looking picture is quite the funny sight to see.
carlos-saenz-de-tejada_the-portal-n-vitoria-fifties,excitement,"There seems to be something festive going on. the yellow of the carriage really stands out against the other colors.I am happy to take a trip on a horse.The wonderful city that is filled with people, horses, and armour releases a western colony setting."
edmund-dulac_the-snow-queen-on-the-throne-of-ice,awe,It is a very detailed and cold looking painting of a ice queen.I feel awe viewing this image of a goddess on what appears to be pieces of a glacier because she has a mesmerizing gaze as if in a trance.The image of the solitary woman is beautiful.
egon-schiele_portrait-of-valerie-neuzil-1912,amusement,"The reddish hair and lips, combined with wide blue eyes, flushed cheeks look like a ginger man wearing makeup and resembling a clown.The brightly colored hair and lips of the person. the orange and reds mixed together work really well.The bright red and orange hair on the person goes well with their grey blue eyes."
eliseu-visconti_a-providencia-guia-cabral,awe,"There is much serenity in this photo through the people and colors used.I love the bright colors, and the soft lines give an ethereal feeling to the piece.The grandeur of the figure floating above.The angel is leading the ship and watching over it.Looks like a dream where a boat full of men is being led by a beautiful naked women. very cool and awesome.A siren or angel that is influencing a man in this painting, i like the mythology aspect."
eugã¨ne-grasset_inqui-tude,excitement,"He's in drag, sneaking away to visit his boyfriend, the soldier.The yellow flowers are beautiful and this woman looks to be enjoing herslf.The woman looks like she's hiding from someone who might find her at any moment."
felix-vallotton_edgar-allan-poe-1895,sadness,"The downturned eyebrows and the clasped hands looks like the man is worried. the ubiquitous black coloring signifies impending doom.A very stark black and white cartoonist depiction of poe, who reminds me of sadness and depression.Starkness of the black and white and the look on that man's face looks sorroful."
felix-vallotton_portrait-of-arthur-rimbaud-1898,sadness,"The color black makes the man look depressed and it makes me sad.There is a dejected sense about her. maybe it is the seemingly pursed lips and the slightly squinted longing eyes.The black and white nature of the image, and the uneasy expression gives you a sense of gloom."

frans-snyders_the-fish-market-1618,disgust,The dead animals everywhere make me feel gross as if there is a disease.The painting depicts a disorganized scene at a seafood market with all kinds of fish laying about in chaos.All the different animals that are dead & trying to be sold. the looks of despair on their faces beings me disgust.

guido-reni_the-victorious-samson-1612,awe,Strong scene of conquer and power with death.There are many dead people around and this man is just enjoying a drink.The detail is all too real in this. im a little disturbed on why the person is stepping on bodies though.

jacob-jordaens_the-holy-family-with-characters-and-animals-in-a-boat-1652,awe,"The woman with her baby seems to be blessed by the heavens with their light clothes and aura.It appears as though the entire community is rallying together to travel on a voyage, with cattle, cargo, and sundry goods - and in the middle of it all is a mary and christ-child figure.   it makes me think of a grueling voyage sustained by faith.The men look exhausted from the day on the sea."

helen-frankenthaler_persian-garden-1966,disgust,The dripping paint is the color of diarrhea or something equally gross.The yellow piece looks like a broken window smeared with dirty butter that is starting to drip down into the puddle.I don't like this picture because it looks like a smear of mustard that is dripping down and i don't like mustard.
helen-frankenthaler_summer-insignia-1969,something else,"Unimpressed. this looks like a color study in fingerpaint by a small child.Kind of neutral, but makes me think of brazil as its flas has these colors.Three different colors just doesn't do it for me, i feel bad for this artist."

mark-rothko_untitled-1969-1(1),something else,"""puzzled"" as to why an artist would ruin the beautiful blue with a brown that clashes.Maybe this is an early  rauschenberg and it makes me curious to find out more about it.This is a brown line on a blue background and it is very boring.  the two colours do go well together."
mark-rothko_untitled-4,something else,The lack of content and detail makes it boring.This makes no sense as to why it would be considered art.There is a hopefulness from where you see the bright pink rising out of the darkness.
mark-rothko_violet-black-orange-yellow-on-white-and-red,excitement,"The pink and yellow make me think of cotton candy, sunny days, festivals, faires, all things happy and summery, which gets me excited.The bright colors and contrast between the pink and yellow is exciting to look at.The bright colors feel like sunshine and make you happy.The bright colors in this combination give an uplifting feel."
morris-louis_alpha-1960,something else,"This just looks like a child might draw strokes down a piece of paper. it doesn't evoke much of any reaction from me.There is a lack of detail and any recognizable shapes, making it boring.The flag like stripes reminds me of the american flag."
morris-louis_tet-1958,awe,"Moonlit waterfalls reveals itself.  if you wish to enter the fairy kingdom, you must offer something of sacred value...The greens and blue are reminiscent of a mountain scene.It reminds me of a large iceberg floating in the ocean.This looks like the plumes of a peacocks tail all spread out."
paul-feeley_the-sculpture-court,amusement,People are standing beside these sculptures to show the scale. the colors are bright and vibrant.Giant art exhibit with contrasting colors that people have probably waited a long time to see.  the people are so small compared to the exhibit pieces.The red & blue squigglys are amusing. looks like a museum from the 60s which is an amusing time.
ray-parker_untitled-1962-1,something else,"Curiosity. it kind of looks like clouds one on top of each other.This a very boring and dull painting.  reminds me of rain clouds stacked on top of one another.I am reminded of paint samples to decide what colors to paint a room, and wonder what the artist meant by this, if anything."
richard-diebenkorn_ocean-park-no-46-1971,something else,"This is just a few shapes and colors, i am so bored and i think the artist was as well, because it looks like something you doodle during a class.Boring: seems as if a few lines, colors and markings where combined in a haphazard fashion.This work seems partial, and as if it is unfinished."
sven-lukin_detour-2012,excitement,"I love the jagged edges and the three-dimensionality of the rectangle in the center of the piece are thrilling.I'm intrigued by the brightly colored, striped ramp-like object in the center of the piece.The bright colors pop out and just lift my mood instantly."
sven-lukin_lemon-peel-1963,excitement,This looks like such a modern logo for a tech company even though it's probably vintage. i like how it bends outwards towards you and the colors are perfect.The bright yellow color and 3-d effect create a dynamic feel.Perfectly perfect. i am a huge fan of symmetry!
sven-lukin_untitled-1969,excitement,"I love the color flow in the design, but most of all i love the design, which reminds me of old-fashioned ribbon candy.The lines from this art are exciting. both the colors and line flow design make me want to move.It looks like a beautiful wall design with contrast colours."
theodoros-stamos_infinity-field-lefkada-series-11-1978,something else,The shapes and shades do not make any sense and they are confusing.I am not sure what to make of this whether or not it is even art.Modern painting of brick red color and a touch of orange on a beige canvas. its elementary looking and not interesting.
theodoros-stamos_infinity-field-t-series-34-1990,anger,"The redness and the nonsense scribbling give of a grumpy feel.I don't think the artist tried here, i think this is a few lines on orange.I like the colors but pictures that don't tell a story i don't like."
theodoros-stamos_sunbox-1966,something else,I'm wondering what the artist is intending to portray here; the green square coming out of a yellow rectangle reminds me of a plant in a pot.This is a half-rotten pop tart bought at a dollar store.I feel bored because i am not a fan of the bland color choices.
william-scott_blue-form-on-white-1964,something else,"I am disappointed by the lack of definite shapes and color schemes in the painting.Beige and white canvas with a blue doorknob and yellow and silver stripes. it's rudimentary looking and not memorable.Confused. i really can't tell what this is. perhaps a blue doorknob.Not sure what this is supposed to be not even sure how i feel about it.The blue stands out to me immediately and looks like a doorknob.Confused on what the many colors mean.There are white random shapes, and some blue and yellow, but no feeling."
eric-fischl_krefeld-project-bathroom-scene-2,disgust,I don't want to see these gross people bathing.  i think the woman on the right is also disgusted by herself.This one creeps me out big time. weird naked people don't do it for me.The scene displays a certain sort of underlying violence.
jamie-wyeth_new-growth-1971,awe,"The shadows and light all look like they are real.Beautiful, feels so real lovely scene.Nature is always beautiful but a stump is a bit awkward, great color scheme though. sunny day!"
jamie-wyeth_slayton-house-1968,fear,"Looks very isolated.This looks like a haunted house. the house looks to be in bad shape and the dark colors spell danger to me.The darkness of the house siding and gray shadows in the windows look scarey, haunted feeling.The lone house with dark wood looks spooky to me."
jamie-wyeth_submerged-1975,awe,I am impressed at the high level of detail.Beautiful shadows and eerie colors. i'm not sure what's going on here but it's got me intrigued.It's a basic scene but the color and shading is masterful.
jamie-wyeth_warm-halloween-1989(1),fear,"I think the painting is scary, because the jack-o-lanterns looks sinister.Carved pumpkin in the field, if that's not scary what is.Scary faces.The scared faces on the pumpkins as well as the one that is rotted brings on a sense of fear."
john-miller_interior-landscape-mauve,sadness,"I feel sad on this, it feels like this person is lost, all alone.There is splendor to the minimal clandestine guilt found in the image.The figure by themselves makes me feel very lonely.  the way they are so slim makes it seem like they are fading away."
john-miller_sunrise-of-wonder-v,excitement,"These colors are bold and exciting.I am excited by the bright colors.It looks like a sunrise on the horizon bringing in a, fresh, new day with endless possibilities."
neil-welliver_nude-in-striped-robe,disgust,Do not think this naked woman prtrait is tasteful.I was not expecting to see a naked woman so i am slightly disgusted by this.Nakedness is not art in my opinion.It looks like some prostitute posing for video shoot.Hate the colors looks like she is green.
richard-whitney_dr-nancy-harrington,awe,This portrait is realistic enough to pass for a photo.Extremely realistic and accurate.The painting is extremely lifelike.
albert-gleizes_arabesque-brush-or-cubist-composition-1952,amusement,The eclectic painting feels light hearted and whimsical even though there is an element of chaos.Interesting mix of colors.An unassuming vessel seems to spill over with what might be remnants of love letter or sprays of flowers in a colorful array.
albert-gleizes_untitled-6,excitement,The people at work in the forefront of nature and community reflect the desire to improve and progress that is at the heart of the human experience.Very talented way to use shapes to depict men.A few friends getting together for laughs and stories.
andre-masson_portrait-of-the-poet-kleist,fear,The blood and mouth as well as the dark colors makes it scary.It looks like a zombie and the way the face is twisted and mouth is open scares me. other than that its.....interesting.This person is either a demon or a victim of a murder. either way it's terrifying.The looks very demonic - like a zombie coming to eat you.
arshile-gorky_painting-1937,something else,"I just looks like somebody spilled their toys, its a mess.This painting makes me feel ill at ease.  there is too much activity in the painting.  the reds and blacks are harsh against each other.  the red on the left looks like a lit matchstick and fire.  on the right the coral and red remind me of a bloody circle of skin.This painting makes me feel confusion.  i have no idea what the artist is trying to convey and can't make out any known objects. while the colors are quite vibrant, i just have no idea what i am looking at."
corneliu-michailescu_still-life-with-fruits,something else,I feel boredom because it is just food and it is not very detailed. it's difficult to tell even what food items they are.Boring. this painting has no interesting subject matter and nothing to draw me in.This makes me feel a bit hungry. it makes me feel this way because of the food that is on the plate. i love grapes and pears and this makes me wish i could pull them up off the plate and eat them myself.
ernst-ludwig-kirchner_sad-female-head-1929,sadness,It seems like the subject is covering their eye in pain.Their inner self is expressed.The use of blues and darker colors as well as the face its self since it has a frown.The figure looks like it is crying and wiping away tears.The frown and geometric shapes make me think it symbolizes a broken heart.
ernst-ludwig-kirchner_traber-team,excitement,"It looks the the horse is being playful and having fun.I feel excitement because i imagine myself being the rider of these two horses and without the whip, it looks exciting and fun.This makes me feel the excitement of going to the sulky racetrack and betting on the horses. i love it.The horses are galloping while the rider is enjoying the ride with their nose in the air."
fernand-leger_discs-1919,excitement,The colors are bright and engaging and the random use of shapes creates a kaleidoscope of detail.For some reason all the colors remind me of being in elementary school.The stacked look and multitude of colors.
fernand-leger_the-creation-of-the-world-bird-drawing-of-costume-1923,amusement,"It looks more like a guitar than a bird, that's funny.This looks like a peacock whom has been dressed up in modern shapes and sizes.The bird like creature is beautifully adorned and i wonder what he represents.The fantastical critter and colors are interesting."
fernand-leger_the-moulin-rouge,amusement,The women's faces are lost amongst the chorus line of legs and skirts.Can-can girls.The character's face seems to be silly.
fernand-leger_the-two-women-bouquet-1921,something else,This paining makes me feel confusion because its very abstract and surreal.It makes me feel love like this is maybe a mother and daughter.The ladies appear to be standing and holding hands. they look courageous like they have to keep each other together to get through the rest of their day. they will make it through. they've put their emotions away.
franz-marc_animal-destinies-the-trees-show-their-rings-the-animals-their-veins,fear,"This is scary, to me. it looks like a mixture of knives and other sharp objects.Reminds me of a wild animal that is harassing a small town killing kids.The shapes and color dramatic as if an animal is being hunted and his final minutes full of commotion."
franz-marc_deer-in-the-forest-ii-1914,excitement,"I like this - its a family of deer, and the color composition shows the hierarchy but also warmth.The bright colours in the painting are quite stimulating.It makes me feel excited because the deer look so alert and they're portrayed with unconventional colors, sharp angles, and fragmentation."
gosta-adrian-nilsson_explosioner-1,fear,The colors are angry and the boat is being blown up.The orange and red look like flames coming out of a boat. the boat looks like it is on fire.This looks like a ship in a angry storm.I feel fear and anxiety because of the fire i see burning up this small ship.
gosta-adrian-nilsson_komposition-1950,something else,"I feel confusion because my mind is searching for the meaning behind the combination of geometric and non geometric shapes and different textures represented by dots in different colors.This brings about confusion. i cannot tell what is going on here.This makes me feel interest because the longer i stare at this painting the more images emerge from the psychedelic mish mash of shapes and colors.Boredom. i am not attracted to paintings that are  nothing more than a melange of various patterns.I am a bit confused as i look at this. it seems mechanical, or industrial. perhaps a musical instrument? i am still confused."
henri-laurens_bottle-and-glass-1917,something else,"I am not sure how to feel about this.Confusion, i don't understand what the image is trying to represent.Different shades of brown or tan with a little white thrown in - abstract art - don't like this particular 'painting' or art."
henri-laurens_untitled-from-dialogues,amusement,"This looks like a man screaming because there is a naked woman.I'm not a fan of abstracts, but it looks like a man is ogling a female figure.  the man's head looks crude, but comical.The blue person appears to not have legs.Abstract of a man seeing a naked woman for the first time.The squiggles look like pubes rushing off the page."
jean-david_figure(3),amusement,"A woman's body is rearranged showing she is the sum of certain parts, most notably her buttocks.The woman who is naked and abstractly drawn looks like she is pregnant and is just oddly shaped.This is a strange picture.  it’s extremely blocky and geometric, yet the artist had to depict genitalia too.The fingers on the right hand resemble crayons."
jean-david_jaffa,amusement,"This art seems childish, but still a lovely representation of an island, with boats in the sea. it makes me smile.The flat and blocky treatment makes the seascape and buildings look like a cartoon.The blocks and colors make this city look like a fun place!I really love the shapes and colors."
joan-miro_not_detected_227962,excitement,"This poster features a beach, and reminds the viewer of traveling europe.It's a stylish ad with interesting graphics. the idea of paris and barcelona and the allure of these cities makes for a exciting concept.So much is going on lots of brightness and different styles makes it active."
juan-gris_the-goblet-1927,something else,"Can't imagine what is happening in the painting, i only feel confused.This painting uses dull colors, and it's boring because you can't see what it is.It is time to throw all the old objects in the garbage can."
julio-gonzalez_homme-cactus-dansant-1939,amusement,"It looks like a monster a little child would draw but it is very good and reminds me of myself at a young age.The painting looks like a lobster wearing a hat while dancing.A playful piece that is funny and silly to view.This looks like a very abstract drawing of a cowboy and a gorilla.It looks like a monkey with a banana arm, wearing a top hat."
julio-gonzalez_monsieur-cactus-1939,something else,"Confusion  metal shapes with spikes that i cannot figure out the meaning of.Looking at it makes me feel confused, it’s like a mixture of cactus with combs mixed together.Part of this sculpture looks like a cactus, i'm not sure what the rest is, it looks to me kinda like a torture devise."
louis-marcoussis_la-table-1930,something else,"Surreal imagery giving off confusion is what is being communicated. bland coloring and confusing shapes.This is very confusing due to the jumble of pictures almost like a puzzle put together wrong.""bored"". the colors are very dull and there's no action in the picture.I don't see or feeling anything with the blocks just stacked."
lyonel-feininger_the-village-of-legefeld-i-dorf-legefeld-i-1916,awe,"This looks like a  castle on top of a hill with a small village underneath, the shadows are ominous.The soft pastels of grey's and the maze type design gives a sense of houses  in the background.It is like a cloud picture but its a city and in the center is either a captain or a boat depending on the angle, it looks so simple but would be very hard to pull all together.The image is captivating, the hard lines make want want to travel into the drawing."
m.-h.-maxy_nude-with-idol-1924,something else,I feel intriguing when i look at this. i cant tell exactly what it is but the figure of the womans body is intriguing.More than anything i feel confused and dont know whats going on in the painting.The color palette and figure are mysterious and sexy.
m.-h.-maxy_nude-with-veil-1922,awe,"This reminds me of stained glass in a church, all the colors coming together to make a beautiful portrait.What great use of simple shapes to make an image of a woman.The picture, as a whole is appealing visually with a nice color selection and shapes orientation together as a collage. when you start to look deeper at the painting and see that the shapes outline a drawing of a woman, it shows the attention to detail to make the underlying photo show."
marc-chagall_david-1914,excitement,"Great energy in this portrait, which actually captures the spirit of the music.It's just a wonderful image, full of life and makes you think of jazz!You can tell he is really playing that instrument with passion."
marc-chagall_the-blue-house-1917,awe,"The purple log cabin stands out nicely against the buildings in the background.The colors used in this painting are very vibrant.  i love the purple/blue color that is used for the house in the forefront of the picture.I adore this abstract, blocky style and the color choices are stunning."
marevna-(marie-vorobieff)_portrait-of-diego-rivera-1960,something else,"It gives me a feeling of respect, like i'm looking at a venerable figure, likely because of the tilt of the head.I don't know how i feel about this. it's realistic and cubism. i don't like cubism but i like realism. but both in one seems interesting.The angular displacement of his face makes me feel uncomfortable."
max-weber_rush-hour,excitement,"The triangles or cones have such a strange vibe like the jazz music of art paintings.Not really sure what it is, however i like all the colors that seem to coordinate together well.This abstract art has achieved its effect in using shapes, forms, colors. i do feel excitement with this abstract."
nzante-spee_david-and-goliath-1995,awe,"The beautiful color scheme creates a journey with a strong sense of adventure. the busy elements add more amazing detail and interest.I'm amazed at the artist's choice to use bright reds, blues, and purples in the piece.The dark and saturated blues contrast well with the dark reds, especially on this person's shirt."
otto-gustav-carlsund_sitting-cubist-woman-1927,disgust,"The body is drawn in an unidealized manner with heavy breasts and rolls of fat, but the face is a blank oval.  it looks grotesque.Looks like a fat monster with breasts, and that neck is awful.The lack of discernible facial features makes this both frightening and revolting."
pablo-picasso_a-reclining-female-nude-1936,disgust,"I see a bloated body, like my spouse who sees herself as ugly. as if someone with severe depression is looking at themself (after having children) and seeing the bloated distortions of their body.. the exploding gut, sagging breasts..fat arms..  its a self portrait of someone who sees themselves as disgusting..I green and yellow do not blend well together and the lines don't flow very well.The grotesque and unrealistic proportions of the persons body as well as the green color make me feel ill and disgusted."
pablo-picasso_bust-of-a-woman-1942,disgust,"Abstract art can be viewed as how the artist really see the inside of a person the dark colors and distorted features  show thoughts that the person has some mental health issues.The woman's face is distorted, creating an unpleasing sensation, as if you're looking into a carnival mirror.The face looks pigish and the colors are ugly."
pablo-picasso_cock-and-knife-1947,fear,The chicken looks like it will be slaughtered shortly and i get a sense of pain and looming fear because of it.Looks like a scorpion is escaping from the persons body.I feel fear as this animal is hacked to pieces.
pablo-picasso_las-meninas-velazquez-1957,amusement,Lots of bold and strong colors in a maze of designs that looks like a village painting.A comic painting of a dog and little boy who is lost in the wizard of oz.This is a fun piece to look at.  there are all sorts of things going on and the colors are really vivid.All of these bright colors look great together. the red and yellow especially.
theo-van-doesburg_composition-the-cow-7,anger,"This is a random sketch of a square, not a real painting.The simple sketch lines tells nothing and confuses me on what this is suppose to be.Looking at this makes me think of a swastika, which only gives me anger."
wifredo-lam_figure-blanche,something else,"I'm still completely unsure of what im looking at after 30 seconds of staring at it.Looks like an anteater learning to walk on two legs for the first time.Surprised. this reminds me of cartoons by rube goldberg. a strange-looking bird, which has a bit of asian dragon look to it, kind of amusing."
yiannis-moralis_not-detected-16,amusement,"The characters deppicted by merging shapes is just so fun to look at.A simple sketch of two figures fornicating, using basic shapes.It looks like a man and a woman facing each other with the woman straddling the man and his hands under her butt... probably having sex.Pictures like this always amuse me, not that they are clearly engaged in sexual activity, but the shapes that are used amuse me, yet also makes me realize we are all different."
andrea-del-castagno_crucifixion-and-saints,awe,There is a reverence in the figures for christ.With the coming holidays and celebration of christmas this picture is the mainstay of the christian religion. this picture is very reverent to me.Because of the religious theme.
andrea-del-castagno_farinata-degli-uberti,awe,This paint real captured and displayed the greatest of his armor.I look at the proud face of the man posing in his best suit of armour and feel awe at this site!This man looks like he could protect me if i was in danger.
andrea-del-verrocchio_the-doubting-thomas-1483,awe,The level of skill needed by the artist is astounding.This is quite beautiful.  i would like to know the meaning behind this sculpture.Ancient statutes in a sacred location.
andrea-mantegna_the-entombment-1459,sadness,"Burial of jesus maybe, whomever, however, still sad, people are grieving.The person being tended to looks close to death, or perhaps already dead.This depicts jesus when he was crucified.I makes me feel sad as somebody is dying in this picture."
antonello-da-messina_portrait-of-a-man-1470,amusement,"His slight smirk makes it look like he is thinking of a private joke.His eyes look like he is keeping a playful secret.He's got this funny grin, like he's in on a joke.Playful look on the face."
benozzo-gozzoli_birth-of-st-francis-prophecy-of-the-birth-by-a-pilgrim-homage-of-the-simple-man,awe,The framing is very pleasant to see.Its the baby jesus.The separation of two different groups of people contrasts with each having people with black halo's over their heads.
benozzo-gozzoli_descent-from-the-cross,sadness,The way the deaths are being handled make me grieve.Taking jesus down from the cross.The details in the characters are amazing but the depiction is depressing.
benozzo-gozzoli_st-fortunatus-enthroned,awe,"Strong subject.  details are incredible  makes me feel in awe of the subject.A merciful person.The pose and strong, forward gaze make the figure appear royal and important.I am not religious, and normally religious things make me angry. artwork is different though. this man appears very important. he is holding some sort of branch and some scripture. he is being exalted by people. i love knowing the stories behind paintings like these."
carlo-crivelli_mary-with-child,awe,It is a religious scene. it evokes piety.The regal purple colors along with the detailed faces of the woman and baby are breathtaking.The features are very well drawn.
carlo-crivelli_piet,sadness,Looks like jesus and grieving angels.The angels crying over jesus dying in their hands.The details of the wounds and the cherub faces are grusome.
carlo-crivelli_saint-paul-saint-john-chrysostom-and-saint-basil,amusement,I am amused because the people in the photo are doing interesting things.Enjoy this old time style and feels fun and usually full of action.That these learned men are all looking for something and none of them capable of finding it.
domenico-ghirlandaio_adoration-of-the-magi-1490,awe,The imagery and detail is beautiful and you can feel the love and respect that the people feel for the central figure.All the gods.The fine little details are incredible.
domenico-ghirlandaio_confirmation-of-the-rule-1485,awe,"A life like moment in time captured.Pictures within the pictures.The characters are all looking at the priest with awe, they all have their gazes locked him.  it looks like a serious scene."
domenico-ghirlandaio_giovanna-tornabuoni-and-her-accompaniment,awe,"The women are wearing beautiful dresses from a different era.I love the ornate and bright costumes of that era.The fabrics, the draping.Anticipation of what's to come. the vivid colors suggest a pleasant outcome, one filled with hope and love."
domenico-ghirlandaio_the-funeral-of-st-fina-1475,awe,"The architecture in the back is astounding.There is basic human mourning, but it also feels as if the entire city--from elders to children--has come out to pay respect, as if a crucial figure in the community has passed.The detail in the painting is precise and very realistic."
fra-angelico_institution-of-the-eucharist-1446,something else,Maybe mercy and forgiveness.  the guys kneeling seem to be begging for forgiveness or praying for mercy.Endless scenes of vaguely religious type make me bored. also the monochrome lacks excitement.The lack of color diminishes the paintings interest.
fra-angelico_marriage-of-the-virgin-1434,something else,"The blackness of the trees in contrast to the light colored buildings gives a sense of foreboding.This takes me back to my catholic upbringing.  it makes me remenicent of history class studying the middle ages.The bright colors, and the wedding happening, always brings joy."
fra-angelico_transfiguration-1442,awe,The god in the center wearing all white make me feel calm.I feel awe for the christ who sacrificed himself.The central figure being highlighted makes him heroic and angelic with his worshippers delighted by his presence.The gold and white circle background makes jesus stand out very brightly as well as the halo's over their heads.
fra-angelico_view-of-the-chapel-vaulting,awe,"This is like a choir divided into sections ready to give a heavenly performance.The lines through the middle make this piece come to life, the look like crossbeams or a tapestry.The detail is extraordinary, and the gold/yellow gives off a very calming, complete feel.Intricately painted chapel ceiling with blues and yellows.Looks like the ceiling in a cathedral. a find a sense of awe and divinity."
giovanni-bellini_dead-christ-in-the-sepulchre-2,sadness,"It is jesus standing in his own coffin, and his face is so sad.The man has had his side pierced and he is saddened.This painting reminds me of isaiah that says jesus is a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief.The man looks to be lost and forlorn."
giovanni-bellini_greek-madonna-1460,sadness,"They both look sad, maybe because they know what will happen in the future.The faces, especially the baby's face have sad expressions on them.Grief and loss of a loved one maybe,  the expressions on both the mother and child are so heartbreaking.The mother and child look so depressed in this, and it's palpable.The sadness in both of their eyes and the way they are looking in the ditance, deep in thought."
giovanni-bellini_madonna-and-child-2,sadness,"The woman looks tired and the child is calm yet observing something above them. so i feel empathy for the woman.The mother looks sad, and the baby looks sick.The woman has a solemn look on her face and the baby appears unfocused."
giovanni-bellini_madonna-with-child-blessing-1464,sadness,"Mary and child drawn in a gloomy fashing due to the dark colors.The mother's expression is blank and despondent, and the lines on her face appear to be trails of tears.The look on their faces is sad and depressing.The streaks in the painting make it look as if the woman is crying."
giovanni-bellini_polyptych-of-san-vincenzo-ferreri-1468-5,awe,"Supernatural strength and protection radiate from the tall, muscular saint who carries the christ child on his shoulders. the expression of pure love and peace with which he looks up at christ reveals where he gets his strength. this is calming and comforting as one realizes we all can access this strength.The woman's muscular legs remind me of the strength of a mother.Such a strong man taking care of his charge and making sure he feel secure."
jacopo-bellini_dormition-of-the-virgin,awe,"So much detail. i feel like i am in this building. i am at awe.I am amazed by the delicate details in the realistic-looking architecture. someone clearly spent a long time working on this.The architecture of this building is majestic, i am in total awe!"
jacopo-bellini_the-twelve-apostles-in-a-barrel-vaulted-passage-1470,awe,"The statues are huddled waiting to get in to heaven, it is inspiring.The perfect symmetry of the arches are awe-inspiring.Makes me think of the ""halls of shangrila"" and the gathering of spirit beings. the whiteness of the painting denotes spiritual enlightenment."
leonardo-da-vinci_self-portrait-leonardo-discovered-a-2009-in-leonardo-s-codex-on-the-flight-of-birds,awe,"The man depicted looks very thoughtful, possibly a bit morose. it seems like he's reflecting on something internally, which inspires wonder in me. i want to know what he's thinking about, what he's looking at, etc.The way that the face is blended with the background is very inspiring.Christ written of ""in the scroll of the book"".The man looks important, and the writing around him looks like history written down."
luca-signorelli_view-of-the-vaulting-of-the-sacristy-of-st-john-1482,awe,"Looks like a very pristine, biblical potrait on a church ceiling.This image is beautiful and grandiose from its multidimensional perspective.The design is segmented into panels that each tell parts of a great story."
paolo-uccello_victory-over-bernardino-della-ciarda-1438,sadness,"It looks like theres a war going on and people are jousting into each other as others fall.I feel sadness due to the generally dark theme and many fallen knights and steeds in this epic medieval battle.The colors of the horses are vibrant, even if they are being killed."
piero-della-francesca_federico-da-montefeltro-1472(1),something else,"Bowed down in humble submission as if to royalty.This painting makes me feel uncomfortable; the proportions seem ""off"", and i don't know if the subject is praying for mercy, or about to be knighted.The knight is clealry having a great day but the feet of the other man are distracting me."
piero-della-francesca_hercules,something else,This painting is odd because of what the man is not wearing.It is very lifelike and kinda of ugly if you were to ask me.He just looks plain. i don't get any tone out of him.
piero-della-francesca_victory-of-constantine-at-the-battle-of-the-milvian-bridge-1464(1),fear,"The man seems to be riding to battle, and that is scary.There is a frightening battling raging. even the horses look scared.Facial expressions look to be just entering a battle and things seem tense and scary."
pietro-perugino_st-jerome-who-resurrected-the-bishop-andrea-1473,sadness,The person in the bed appears to be ill.The person in the bed seens to be sick or dying.This painting depicts a man in his dying hour.
sandro-botticelli_adoration-of-the-child(1),awe,Tender picture that shows the emotions on their face.This is very sweet image because of the small child.There seems to be some kind of divine worship happening in the work.
sandro-botticelli_judith-leaving-the-tent-of-holofernes-1500(1),excitement,"The story to this painting seems quite interesting, a pregnant woman going to war.I love seeing a strong woman in this painting. her holding the guys head is just interesting!Strength and femininity shown here. the feminine swell of the pregnant belly couples well with the strength of carrying a severed head."
sandro-botticelli_madonna-del-magnificat-1485(1),awe,Beautiful piece that pops out with color especially the reds.The woman and child releases a schoolhouse look that is nested inside of a victorian style frame.Feel like this takes place a few hundred years ago. seems like a family and maybe angels.
sandro-botticelli_the-birth-of-venus-1485(1),awe,"The colors of this painting are a bit muted and dark, but the attention to detail and harmony between the people and nature in the picture capture my attention and interest.The nude figure in the center inspires a sense of wonder, as if she is the very essence of beauty.The elegance of the pretty woman in the middle attracting lots of fans with the others flying to her, is truly awe inspiring.Birth of venus.  truly a masterpiece.  the beauty of the female for on full display."
sandro-botticelli_the-virgin-adoring-the-child-1490(1),something else,"Concerned/worried. their faces look like they are concerned or worried about something.Mary and jesus surrounded by a bevy of archangels. the expressions are all blank, solemn or very pious.The bored looking and unhappy faces make me feel uneasy."
akseli-gallen-kallela_lemmink-inen-s-mother-1897,sadness,"The colors and the scene make me feel sad.It appears that the man is deceased and the woman is praying.I am sad becasue the woman seems to have tried her best to help this man, without success.  she is not content with his passing, but sadened that she could not do more.  she looks for understanding without answers.She looks to be praying for help.Image of death of man laying floor with head covered woman placing hand over his chest and looking up for mercy.A nun sits over a deceased man with her hand on his abdomen as she looks up to the sky..It looks like someone is clearly dying in this painting."
albert-bloch_scherzo-1926,fear,In the center it looks like two people with no heads.People are garding their faces in fear.Anything human-like in this picture seems very distressed.
alexander-calder_yellow-tights-1945,something else,The concentric circles are dizzying and lightly off putting. it gives me a sense of unease.The subject looks to be confused and dazed because the eyes don't look focused.I feel silly looking at this painting it's a monkey.
amedeo-modigliani_female-nude-with-hat,disgust,The nakedness is bold and offensive.The tone of this person is just off-putting and kind of gross.The strange use of yellow and gray here achieve a sense of disgust and awe simultaneously.Very distorted human face with a unappealing naked body makes me feel disgusted.
amedeo-modigliani_portrait-of-a-young-woman-1,sadness,I hate that this photo seems to be of a woman who is extremely sad. i don't like that she seems tired and overrun with emotion.There is sadness in the eyes and the mouth and darkness in the outfit.She looks really sad.The woman looks very sad.
amedeo-modigliani_woman-s-head-rosalia,amusement,The large face looks funny sitting atop the skinny neck.Looks like a portrait that an elementry school child made.The head is much larger than the neck.

balthus_the-child-with-pigeons,something else,"I am confused about what the man is looking at.  the focus is above the plant and out of the picture.  i see the birds, but they are to the right of his gaze.  i would think they were making enough noise to attract his attention?Not to be around the bush - this painting is ordinary, colors are ok - i'm not sure whether the birds are inside or out.Boring painting of a guy looking up at birds flying or whatever caught his attention."
basuki-abdullah_balinese-ceremony,something else,It looks as though riots are breaking out and the sky is on fire.This painting evokes curiosity. the tall building with people below make me want to know the story.The contrast of the tall tower and smaller figures seems meaningful but the narrative is unclear and confusing.
billy-childish_robert-walser-lying-dead-in-the-snow-2008,excitement,"The harsh brush strokes, use of color, and falling top hat cause me to engage with the image.I like the movement of the white like snow and the men out on the lake.The surreal and dreamlike color patterns here really makes you feel at ease.The mix of colors comes together well to make a figure."
carlos-orozco-romero_woman,fear,The woman's eyes are very dark and intense.She puts me on edge.  like she has key information and isn't willing to share it.How close you are to the woman's face and her black eyes.

carlos-saenz-de-tejada_the-enchanted-forest-holy-company,awe,This man appears to be wise to his situation and is content with it.The scale of charcoal grays gives this a smokey effect that i like.The lines in the face and bold eyebrows add details to the man's face.
chaim-soutine_landscape-of-cagnes,fear,The branch in the front of the picture looks like a large hand!The colors are unsettling in the painting and the images in the road appear to be fleeing from something.The blackness that surrounds the sleepy town is scary.
chaim-soutine_mother-and-child,fear,"The woman holding the child seems to be missing an eye and has an overall eerie feeling.The creepiness of this artwork is further enhanced by the muddy browns and greys in the background.What happened to the poor girl, that she and the doll have traded places.The child is missing an eye and that doll is really creepy looking.For some reason this is a very disturbing image.  the person's face looks damaged and inhuman, while the doll in her lap looks alive.  this is like something from a horror movie, and the dark colors around the subject only intensify the creepy vibes."
charles-demuth_the-shine-1916,disgust,The different class of people at the top and bottom makes it uncomfortable to look at.The pleasing upturned faces to the clients kind of makes me angry for the shoe shiners.The painting depicts a stark contract between the working class and aristocrats.

dimitris-mytaras_untitled-1990,disgust,"There are some awkwardly shaped limbs and faces, and some mucky colors.Wow, just wow. vibrant colors, but this should not be referred to as 'art'.The distorted women in odd colors don't look right."

endre-balint_self-portrait-1936,amusement,"Kind of funny looking, facial features are large.It is almost a caricature with the big eyes and angular face.I love the shape of this man's head and his right eyebrow.Funny looking facial features as his head is big and so are his eyes and nose."

ernst-ludwig-kirchner_portrait-of-a-sick-man,fear,"Grotesque looking man creature with snarly hands and a mean and angry expression.The contrast of black and white always accentuates the scariness of a painting or drawing.This dark character looks evil and like i'm being threatened.This painting makes me feel fear, the man looks large and scary. the lack of color enhances fear."
ernst-ludwig-kirchner_rhaetian-railway-davos,fear,"Darkness envelops a train in the mountains as the mysterious man at bottom right hovers with sinister intentions.The dark shadows are very scary in how the scene is represented.The overwhelming darkness over the town gives a sense of foreboding.I see a train struggling to get up a hill, the man standing outside the train is a disturbing figure.The tall lanky man just standing there is quite disturbing and brings fear."

ernst-ludwig-kirchner_staffelalp-by-moonlight,fear,The dark colors and harsh lines makes this a bit grim.This black and white scene feels like a storm at sea.The violent lines suggest catastrophic turmoil in an ocean or battlefield.This scares me because you can see a face in the art work. terrifies me.
ernst-ludwig-kirchner_street-scene-in-front-of-the-shop-window,fear,The intense lines and lack of color evoke a sense of fear.The men surrounding the accused int he middle seem to hold his life or death in their decisions.The crowd of dark men surrounding another makes you think they are going to do something bad.

filipp-malyavin_three-women-1902,fear,"All the women's faces are at the top of the painting which makes me feel like i am very short, looking up to them. the woman on the right is frowning and depicted in red so she feels menacing. the woman in the middle is smiling, but her form is much more ambiguous which makes me not trust her. the woman on the left is set furthest back in the painting and is partially obscured, but her facial expression looks worried. i fear for my safety.Two of the three people look dead, and the woman on the left has a terrified look suggesting she is next.These women look like witches and one looks like she is holding a chainsaw.The women in this image look evil and like they're judging the viewer.The perspective makes it creepy the way everyone is standing over the viewer.The reds make the woman look like a zombie."
frank-auerbach_j-y-m-seated-no-1,fear,"Holy hell, that's supposed to be a woman? it looks like a spider being consumed by black flames!This picture has a distorted picture in it and it looks scary.The dark lines and pale splashes around what seems like the head look like a skeleton."
frank-auerbach_maples-demo,disgust,"The yellow color used for this reminds me of baby poop; reminds me of finger painting.The colors and texture remind me of baby poop. i can't see past it to think anything else.This color is really ruff on the eyes because its the color of what a baby would leave in a diaper.I really don't care for this muddy yellow-brown shade they are using, it reminds me of fecal matter."
franz-marc_the-red-deer-1912,awe,"The softness and the way the bodies flow show a serenity in the animals.Full of color. 'fanciful' isn't the right word, but it seems like you can feel movement.There seems to be a shaman feel in this photo with the two foxes.Scientists are surprised to discover that fawns will howl at the moon."

georges-rouault_crucifixion-1937,disgust,This looks like the crucification of christ and the color just inspire nausea.Ok i normally like abstract stuff but this is just a weird religious picture -- it's neat in that it's got a lot of detail in this image with such broad lines that look like they have no details.It makes me mad a human is hanging on a cross.
grã©goire-michonze_self-portrait-1971,fear,The mans sharp features and intense gaze make me wary of him.A sketch of a mans face that reminds me of a serial killer sketch.The expression of the subject is like he is staring into your soul.Those eyes are bugging they are super creepy.

hedda-sterne_saul-steinberg-1950,something else,"Its not hte most amazing drawing. its good, but its not anything amazing.This drawing is of a man who is busy trying his luck in drawing.This is simple it almost looks unfinished the lines are light the sleeves on the shirt do not match it feels like it is not quiet done.Pencil drawing of a man, balding with glasses and a sweater. he is writing and seems intellectual and intense."
henri-matisse_interior-with-black-fern-1948,disgust,"The cheetah pattern on the floor clashes big time with the red wall in my opinion. i find that it just looks gross. there's no face on the woman either which isn't appealing.I very much do not like the bold yellow, especially with the black spot pattern on it.It makes me feel like i am in an alternate reality where a vase can come alive."
henri-matisse_not-identified-25,anger,This lady is dressed in her purple dress and is angry because she has to wait.Her expression says she is not impressed. with you.Her facial expression is angry and her arms are crossed which makes her seem standoffish.

henri-matisse_standing-odalisque-reflected-in-a-mirror-1923,disgust,"The woman poses without expression but the mirror reflects her boredom and disinterest in the person she waits for.She is naked, this photo is gross and inappropriate with her tits showing.The patterns and lack of any clarity to the facial features of the woman make me feel depressed as if things are off center and not fashionable."
henri-matisse_woman-with-a-veil-1942,something else,She is transparent both physically and mentally i think.I feel nothing with this one it is a boring portrait.I don't think the colors used inspire anything in the face.Her hair does not contrast well with her skin.
horia-bernea_bread-1976,disgust,"The psychadelic melting of colors reminds me of vomit.The use of the place mens of red over this round objects gives me disgust feelings. it reminds me of part of the body bleeding out.This rock looks really ugly. there's a lot of random colors and stains on it, which might be blood or something else."
horia-bernea_the-column-1997,something else,"The painting looks like it's half-finished, lacking in intricate detail.I feel confused because this painting is so strange. i don't know what it is.I don't have any feeling about this.there aren't many details i can latch on to. it kinda looks like a nice rug."
ilka-gedo_artificial-flower-on-a-naples-yellow-background-1980,something else,"Nothing - looks like cement discolored and cracked on a bar floor.It just looks like a rusty metal door, like it's been exposed to the elements and is decaying.The picture confuses me, i cant make out if this is meant to be a hanging stand."
ilka-gedo_ganz-factory-1948-1,sadness,A man puts in many lonely hours at ty he factory he works at.This suggests chaos and hard repetitive work done by an anonymous figure.It looks like this lady is working in a supermarket with a checkbook and stacks of cash to her right.The picture expresses an emotion of loneliness.
ion-pacea_peisaj-de-litoral-1973,disgust,"It looks like a close u shot of the eye of a colourful south american tree from, but given the red and white colour scheme, likely one of the poisonous ones.This looks like a blue eye surrounded by red, bloody lids and canthus. the swirling grey at the bottom is disturbing and suggests the flaking skin of a corpse.Looks like an eye floating in blood which is gross."
ion-tuculescu_circuits,disgust,"Looking at all these circles and colors is just giving me a headache.I don't like the odd, repetitive eye motif and the random use of colors.This is just one ugly mess, awful colors, looks like it was just slopped on the page by a child, not art to me!"

istvan-farkas_self-portrait-1932,something else,This painting doesnt invoke too much emotion in me. coloring is neutral and the guy just looks tired or sleeping.This painting is weird you could kinda see his facial expression on the shadows and background.Doesn't do much for me emotionally.  not a huge fan of this type of portrait.
ivan-albright_self-portrait-no-18-1983,something else,"It looks like a blurred version of the pope.The facial expression and the shading, line colouring, it makes me feel like whoever did this may have made a severe mental illness.It appears to me to be a slightly distorted sad face of the pope.The lack of details on the person except the eyes is very disappointing."
jackson-pollock_bird-1941(1),fear,"The staring psychotic eye seems to be opening a portal to another dimension.The colors mix in strange ways almost like they are in motion, while it is ambiguous what the figure in the foreground is, its black lines appear to be grasping at me like claws. the use of blues and reds in the eye in the background make it feel menacing and judgmental.The giant single eyeball sticks out, and it is not pleasant.  the heads at the bottom are also not good.  i don't want to know what this painter is trying to portray.The floating eye and misshapen heads are very strange and mystical."
jean-paul-lemieux_jeune-fille-l-hiver-1977,sadness,Man despairs that he sees a bigfoot in the distance but he has no camera in his cell phone.Person alone in the snow with a couple visible in the distance.The dull gray colors make this look sad and her expression is sad.The picture has an overall cold feel and the child looks lonley.
jean-paul-lemieux_julie-et-l-univers,something else,"The central figure being off center makes me feel off kilter.Confusion..there is the collar of a cleric yet the face has feminine features and the yellow coat.Even though the skies are yellow it looks like it's cloudy, the man standing in the front with the bright orange rain coat and black hat, makes it feel this is a raining cold day."

jose-gutierrez-solana_still-life-with-dead-turkey,disgust,"The sharp scene of a dead turkey or chicken is repulsive to me as it reminds me of pucking chickens as a child and that i did not enjoy.The dead chicken on the table bothers me because of its positioning.Dark colors give it a negative vibe, painting looks very unorganized like dirty dishes and the knife is somewhat ominous."
jose-gutierrez-solana_two-women,something else,"The feeling is nothing, a simple moment, with nothing to react to, elegently presented.There's a sense of eroticism the way the woman is taking off her top.Dark colors two woman one half dressed pulling off shirt, dull just two woman changing ."
jules-pascin_portrait-of-hermine-david-1910,something else,"Bored, it's just a woman looking at a piece of people. no emotional significance behind this illustration at all.A aristocratic looking woman reading a book at a table. she seems severe and intelligent.Has a more introspective feel; facial expression at what she is looking at raises questions."

jury-annenkov_the-intellectual,amusement,"The swirling curved lines that form the man's hair and the unusual geometric shapes that are on his glasses make me laugh, as does his smile.This painting makes me, with funny drawing of a man.This is such a fun, comical line drawing with he integration of musical notes in the subject's hair."
kees-van-dongen_parisian-lady-1910,amusement,The lady's hat looks like a cloud or puff of smoke covering her face.The woman is peering down enjoying the antics of her tiny dog.A fancy lady taking her dog for a walk. the contrast in the colors is interesting.The woman looks like she has a long rubber neck.The small tiny dog really lightens the tone of this portrait and it makes me smile.
lajos-tihanyi_portrait-of-a-child,amusement,"This picture makes me feel contentment because of the style of drawing and the pink and red colors used.Her face looks quite vexed, kind of like lolita, if she realized how problematic it was.The upset/disgusted look of this young girl is somewhat humorous."
ligia-macovei_party,amusement,"The festive colors are energetic and exciting, but they features on the faces of the figures seem out of place as they look bored or deep in thought about something besides the festivities.This is the last of this party's attendance by these three who will have a lot of fun.Everyone looks so sad at this party, almost like even the drinks wont fix the problems they have."
lovis-corinth_ecce-homo-1925,sadness,Makes me sad thinking of death or someone is going to die.The man seems to be bleeding from his hands and is tied up.A woman is bleeding and appears to be getting sent to her execution.This looks to be jesus with his hands tied and a crown of thorns. i am so thankful for him.
lovis-corinth_the-walchensee-mountains-wreathed-in-cloud-1925,fear,The splashes of black paint look like tentacles and are unnerving for me.The water looks dangerous since it's swirling so much.This feels like what you would see if you were underwater.  the colors are running together in such a way where it feels you are looking from under water.The leaves and plants look like tentacles of aliens to me.The dark shadows reaching toward the blue seem to be taking over the brighter colors and bringing darkness.
lucian-freud_ali-1974,sadness,"The person looks weary and like they have given up trying.  their clothes don't fit, and they have a look of despair.This woman's expression is blank and empty, and her shirt is tousled, suggesting she is stressed.This painting is a little disturbing for me, the person represented in it looks very distraw and sad, and ill maybe?"
lucian-freud_father-and-daughter-1949,fear,The mans wide eyes and how his hand is on the child makes me think he is holding him hostage.The man's face stuns you the second you look at it.I don't like the face the man is making as he's holding the child.The man in this painting is terrifying; it feels like he is going to take the child and the child looks scared.The mans expression seems creepy as he peers from behind the beaded curtain.

lucian-freud_naked-portrait,disgust,"The face of the lady is unappealing and makes me disgusted.It is kind of gross not wearing clothing while resting on the sofa.This painting makes me feel disgust, perhaps due to the dark colors used to create the vein-like lines on the female form.The subject is very unappealing to me and the woman's large body and nose make her seem so sloppy."
lucian-freud_naked-solicitor,disgust,"The nude woman's body is covered with rolls of fat and stretch marks, it's hard to look at.It's just a pretty disgusting body lit with all its unflattering fat rolls intact.Holy hell, that has to be one of the ugliest broads i've ever seen! yuck! my stomach turns with this one."
lucian-freud_the-pearce-family,sadness,"The family expressions are a bit sad, serious, and definitely melancholy.This man and woman are miserable together but they have to stay together for the sake of the kids.A darkness has descended over this family, clouding and distorting their faces with worry and pain."
m.c.-escher_not_detected_204724,something else,"I'm confused by why all the lines extend through the man as well, and what all the words mean.There is a big world out there and you want to stay in and read.That windmill represents something important but i dont know what."
max-beckmann_afternoon-1946,fear,The man in white seems to be in pain as he is attacked by the other.Getting into a situation that is too much to handle.The black and green strands holding down the girl is scary. the creature with the abnormally large hands next to her is creepy.
max-beckmann_departure-1935,fear,"The first part is a bit gory with red blood and images the other two are a bit dark in colors.The multiple figures that appear to be tied up makes me anxious.These people look like they're being captured, bound up, and tortured."
max-kurzweil_martha-kurzweil-before-an-easel-1902,something else,The way the woman is staring away from us makes me very curious as to what she is looking at.This painting looks rushed and as if it didn't take the artist very long to complete.The painting looks too roughly done with the splashes of paint to be considered a professional one.
max-pechstein_at-the-lantern,fear,"The use of red, yellow and black and the angry scene of a hanging and people rioting make this feel like a propaganda poster which scares me.I really dont like all of the darker painted people and the fact that someone looks as though they are hanging from the light pole dead.This scene looks horrifying, there is a man being hung from a lamp."
max-pechstein_the-masked-woman-1910,fear,"This person is hiding who they are and it's disconcerting.The gray skin of the person makes the picture a bit creepy.The eyes are vacant, which makes this person look nefarious - like the joker in batman.I feel like this person means harm and that they are intentional in their decision.The color of the womans face looks like she came out of the grave.I feel that this painting is gross.  i do not like the mask as the bold colors.Seems the blanked out eyes in this painting and the hard edged mask mean something fearful."
neil-welliver_figures-under-tree,amusement,The trees look like they are dripping on the people below.Men in suits with naked ladies under a tree.Why are the women nude while men sit in suits? this is most amusing.
oskar-kokoschka_not_detected_235831,disgust,The woman's red face makes her look rather ugly in nmy opinion.The spots on the woman's legs and wall look like a plague.The red colors used in this painting make it feel like specs of blood were spattered onto it which is very unappealing to me.
oskar-kokoschka_not_detected_235840,disgust,"The dark shading makes this sketch too chaotic. it is hard to make out the details between the creatures.The painting looks like a strange, ugly beast with tentacles for hands.It looks messy, and not a great deal of details.  i can barely make out the snake in the middle."
oskar-kokoschka_not_detected_235841,fear,The mask on the right is terrifying and not pleasant to look at.These rough lines and the scared expression on the man on the right are disturbing.The stribbly lines and the off-putting faces and gestures makes this photo scary.
oskar-kokoschka_not_detected_235844,disgust,"I am a bit unnerved by the individuals presented in this piece. their overall body shape and facial complexion feel very sad.This looks depressing and dirty because the people are naked, and sad looking. t hey seem as if they are in limbo or purgitory.The men in the painting have wrinkled skin and look ugly."
oskar-kokoschka_not_detected_235863,sadness,It looks like these are two lovers and they are embracing because they are sad.The couple appears to be huddling together for warmth in the freezing cold.The two lovers embrace and it makes me sad.The women are clutching each other as if shaking in fear.
ossip-zadkine_at-the-water-s-edge,awe,The figures are as pale as two ghosts as the sunbathe.The proportion on the two(?) nude figures are off to such an extent that one becomes fascinated while trying to piece them together!The way the two subjects are posing in front of each other in outdoor surrounds gives a sense of wonder.
ossip-zadkine_visitors-to-the-sun,disgust,"It's creepy that one person's body is fractured down the middle.The figures in the painting lack a coherent color scheme and looks ugly.I feel like the anatomy is crudely drawn, and it appears that the peach-colored figure is being disembodied, suggesting a personal violation."
otto-dix_apotheosis,excitement,"I love the power she displays, her stride is moving the whole world behind her.This one is pretty cool, it's messy with lots of detail going on.There is a lot of bold movement in this picture."
otto-dix_buried-alive,fear,"The dark black lines and gray hue is stark, these seem to be 2 soldiers dead.Uneasy scene all around, from the skulls to what seem like arms sticking up to the dark black lines everywhere.With the skulls this looks like the aftermath of war.The mood is dark and bodies can be seen in the foreground!"
otto-dix_corpse-of-a-horse,disgust,"The painting shows a decaying corpse of a horse, making for a frightening sight.This sketch of a decomposing equine carcass is sure to create revulsion in the viewer.Looks like a dead carcass that has been out for awhile, torn apart.A dead deer with a hole in it's side decaying. this evokes disgust, but it's the intent of the painting for a change."
otto-dix_old-woman,disgust,Gross sketch of gross old man will gross expression on his face.This reminds me of the old dead lady that jack nicholson was making out with in the shining and it creeps me out.This man looks old and malnourished and on the brink of death.
pablo-picasso_celestina-1904,fear,The woman under the cape looks like a witch.This makes me feel a bit like death is watching over the other two individuals.The individual in the blue hood is quite scary and gives me the creeps. it makes me feel something is wrong.
pablo-picasso_crouching-woman-1902,sadness,"The blue colors match the individual's current state of sadness.The person in this painting looks very sad and cold.The blue shades elicit a very wanting feel and the figure seems to have fallen asleep gazing off the ledge.It makes you feel sad because of the scene and the color.I am sad because his hood is over his head, and his head is tucked in close to him. he seems defeated. the array of blue tones also evokes a feeling of despair and loneliness.I can feel this person's sadness and despair. it seems like this person is at the end and has exhausted all their resources.The way the person is almost curled up in a ball with their head down, looks very sad."
pablo-picasso_the-family-of-blind-man-1903,sadness,The blue hues and the gauntness of the human figures imparts a sense of hardship and despondence.The various shades of blue makes this painting very sad and the expression on the the man's face can be described as forlorn.There is something about the way the blue is used that makes me feel utterly sad as i see this family.
pablo-picasso_woman-with-brooch-1944,amusement,"This looks like carole baskin wearing a giant cheese wedge on her head, so its amusing.The hat she's wearing looks like a scottish tam and it clashes with the egyptian brooch.I like the bright colors used, the dark blues with the yellows and reds create contrast."
paul-klee_women-in-their-sunday-best-1928(1),fear,It is a scary green monster that will attack me in my nightmares.The dark look and the ominous shapes suggest a frightening scene to me.It looks like the profile of a witch with green skin wearing a big hat.
paula-modersohn-becker_bridges-in-paris-1905,sadness,The person standing by the water is shrugging their shoulders as if depressed.The lone figure by the river while people walk by in groups on the bridge above.The lack of color and the man in the foreground's isolation brings a sense of gloominess.
paula-modersohn-becker_nude-girl-sitting-on-the-floor-1904,sadness,"The posture of the person in the picture leads me to believe that they are unhappy, which makes me feel unhappy.The young girl has no clothes to wear and is embarrassed by her nakedness.The sketch of the woman feels like a ghostly outline.This woman seems like she's reflecting on past regrets."
paula-modersohn-becker_old-woman-with-handkerchief,sadness,"His face expression reminds me of a weeping loved one at a funeral.Downcast eyes and red nose and cheek person and clutching a handkerchief this person is sad and was crying.The black clothing, possibly a handkerchief of some type in the subject's hand and her expression remind me of a widow in mourning.The man realizes money does not buy happiness.His facial expressing and the way he is holding the paper in his hands."
paula-modersohn-becker_self-portrait,fear,"The women's facial expression is very intimidating and she looks pretty scary.I feel fear when i look at this painting because the lady looks scary to me.She seems mentally deranged, i don't like the hollow eyes and how her pupils are pointing."
pierre-alechinsky_stars-and-disasters-astres-et-d-sastres-1969-1(1),amusement,Love the blending of colors in the upper corner and the faces of the creatures look a little scary.The beings look appear to have weird faces with no eyes or mouths. one is female.The artist has decided to give the female deer human breasts.
pierre-alechinsky_with-two-brushes-a-deux-pinceaux-1978,fear,"The bottom things look like the bones of a victim that the weird dragon ate with blood splattered on the picture.There is a lot of chaos here, my eye can't find any pattern or peace. the shapes feel threatening.I feel afraid, because the drawings look like torture implements."
pierre-tal-coat_blue-vase,sadness,"Not much going on, a sad little place looking poor and an item knocked down on the floor.The vase and the white box look like they have been abandoned in a desert environment.The candlestick has been knocked over, so this painting lacks light."
pierre-tal-coat_femme-allong-e,something else,"The shapes making up the figure are so basic that it looks like a first grader painted it.This painting makes me feel unnerved- the absence of the woman's face is unnatural and somewhat disturbing, despite the calm and flat colors of the work.This is a bit strange - the person appears to be made up of different shapes."
ramon-oviedo_forma-de-emitir-sonidos,fear,Another prototype of the virus they are trying to find a cure for but no one knows where it came from. looks like it anyway.The red background is omonous and the object looks threatening.The suspended thing looks dangerous and scary to me. the back shadow is ominous.
ramon-oviedo_por-que-dulce-ca-a(4),disgust,The shapes remind me of discarded parts and give me an uneasy feeling.One side of the portrait looks like asparagus.  however the other side looks confusing.I don't like the smearing effect used in this. it makes it look gross.
richard-gerstl_man-in-meadow-alban-berg-1907,amusement,"The man seems to be trying to ignore the man in the background, who appears to have his pants down and urinating on the tree.He looks like he's giving serious side eye to someone out of frame.The way the man is laying looks very uncomfortable, especially dressed in the apparel he is wearing."
richard-gerstl_portrait-of-a-seated-man-1908,amusement,"Yikes, he looks like my ex father in law, down to the mustache.Looks like the man in the painting has a painting of himself behind him, that is an amazing power move.The man has a spot of hair on his bald head top, which is hilarious."
richard-gerstl_self-portrait,disgust,"Ew... naked man!  and not a pretty one at that!I hate looking at naked people. i think naked people are disgusting.This man looks sickly blue, and the background only makes it worse."
sa-nogueira_figure-1,sadness,"This makes me sad, looking at the darkness that is overtaking her.It doesn't look finished and is proportioned oddly.The woman has no clothes on and looks demonic."
salvador-dali_er-tu-puer-prophetia-altissimi-luke-1-76,fear,"This man looks injured, since his body is a mass of bloody cuts.Painting of a young person looking scared and ready to defend themselves.The dark brown/red and the crinkles on the page really gives it a very dark and sinister feeling.This boy seems like he's coated in blood, since the painting has so much red splashed on it.It looks like the man is going to stab someone with the black pointy item.The figure seems shrouded in some strange ethereal presence."
salvador-dali_portrait-of-el-sany-pancraci,amusement,"The man's eyes are abnormally large, and staring to the side as if he has been interrupted while posing for the portrait.The man's face and eyebrows feels like a satire.This guy looks like a silly character, likely from a political cartoon."
salvador-dali_the-picnic,excitement,The painting shows some form of party or get-together where people are being daring with holding and interacting with nude women.The nudity contrasts with the outdoors and clothed men to evoke a sense of freedom and carelessness.All these naked ladies make me think of having a orgy and that exciting.
salvador-dali_velazquez-dying-behind-the-window-on-the-left-side-out-of-which-a-spoon-projects,amusement,"So what is the deal with the eggs? they make no sense. i wish i could understand the message that the artist is trying to get across, but it is funny to look at even if i dont get the message.Kind of a funny painting. he doesn't quite have egg on his face, but close. short legs, short arms. very strange and different.The scrambled deviled egg is really a funny concept."
serge-sudeikin_cabaret-halt-of-comedians-my-life-1915,something else,"This painting does not make me feel any way.  i am not sure how to analyze it as it has a lot going on. the part i like is the woman looking in the mirror.I am confused by this painting, there is so much going on in one piece. happiness, scared, sadness. the people in the painting are all showing different emotions.Dislike all of it.  especially the sharpness of the faces.  the scene is odd.  not sure what's going on."
theo-van-doesburg_abraham-kuyper-1910,amusement,The man looks like he has seen better days.This man's face looks very fat and cartoonish looking. very silly features.The man seems annoyed by the angels flying over head.
theo-van-doesburg_krishna-playing-a-flute-1916,amusement,The artist made the butts of the figures square and funny shaped.The sketches ate cartoonosh and show people woth large booties.This looks like a bad drawing someone made on a napkin or something.What else but amusement? it's a sketch of a bunch of butts! interesting insight to a process though.
tia-peltz_the-brat-girl-1,amusement,"The little girl has very big eyes and her cheeks are too big.Cute pic, but her eyes are lopsided.This girl looks like a bug with huge eyes wearing a wig masquerading as a human."
tivadar-kosztka-csontvary_teacher-in-morocco-1908,awe,"The mans long grey beard makes him look extremely wise.The vien on the forehead makes the face looks true to life.The figure seems almost mystical. the colors are weird but don't bother me because the whole scene feels surreal.The hood surrounds his face like a modern-day halo. he holds the book up, but he already knows what is written there, so he looks at his interlocutor to see if he has figured it out yet."
toyen_a-girl-at-the-construction,sadness,"The woman looks out the window hoping for better days ahead.Something about this makes me think of suicide - the object on the left looks like a giant razor blade and the woman looks like she's reached her wit's end.The measuring sticks near this woman's face remind me of the constant need people feel to be perfect.The eyes look sad and beat up, makes me sad and disturbed."
tsuguharu-foujita_christ-en-croix,awe,The golden halo over jesus's head and crown of thorns feels like he has heavenly protection!I believe in a jesus that hung on the cross for my sins and this picture reminds me of what he was willing to do -to pay for my sins.I am in awe of this graceful rendition of the crucifixion of christ.
vajda-lajos_lel-t-s-a-templomdombr-l-1929,fear,"It is kinda creepy and weird, plus so dark and gloomy.The darkness of it is overwhelming.  the middle of it looks like it is staring.The shadows are dark and gloomy.    the houses look like they have eyes.  it almost looks like a maze, which is unknown and scary.The sharp lines are chaotic and unsettling this makes me feel scared and uneasy.The dark hues and the two dots in the middle makes it look like a pair of evil eyes.The colors make this look very hauntred.The inconsistent perspective and harsh shadows are confusing."
vajda-lajos_monster-s-head-1938,fear,"The creature is evil looking, the lack if color makes me feel like i am seeing this in the dark night, and the stitches around the mouth are the scariest part.The eyes in the picture look dark and evil.The dark jagged lines look like a scary clown hanging over someone.There appears to be a cage of some type over this creature's mouth. i am afraid of the reasons why it has been so violently restrained."
vasile-kazar_unknown-title-1,disgust,"This painting looks like two very weird men are dancing and kissing while holding body parts of other humans.The figures in the painting appear to be connected together, which is ugly.A grotesque looking figure that i can't really put my finger on."
yiannis-tsaroychis_athlete-1967,amusement,"The man's hair is made of green leaves from a tree.The subject looks as if he doesn't want to pose for the painting. he also reminds me of the jolly green giant's nephew, sprout.The image looks a bit cartoonish and lacks imagination."
zinaida-serebriakova_portrait-of-ivanov-in-a-suit-spaniard-1924,awe,The woman has an absolutely gorgeous headpiece since it's crafted from real birds' feathers.I like the texture in the woman's dress..the ruffles and the dots...it looks very opulent.It is beautiful and the over all details is almost perfect that it looks so real.
andre-derain_bacchus-dance-1906,amusement,"It looks a woman is dancing while her friends watch.The bodies playing in the field look like they are having fun.The colors and motion suggested make me think of a relaxed but still somehow lively party.This was hard, i didn't see all of the figures at first. it looks like 2 females at a festival and one gets up and starts dancing and because she is so much motion, she is red like in an infrared scope or something. it is kind of funny because maybe the one on the right could be drunk."
armand-guillaumin_paysage-de-la-creuse-printemps,excitement,Beautiful display of colors.A colourful place.The colors are very bright and engaging.The scene is vibrant with bright colors of various tones.
armand-guillaumin_rochers-sur-la-c-te-agay-1907,excitement,High rocks brings excitement of unknown place.The scene looks relaxing but the activity of the water makes it quite lively.Red cliff is very exciting to look contrast with blue sea.

charles-lapicque_ferme-en-bretagne,amusement,"The colors are very vibrant and looks like lots of scribbles brought together to make one painting.It gives an effect of rainbow and house in a landscape.This one made me smile, and even chuckle a bit at the wide scope of pallette the artist chose. made me think of a mill in the fall out in new england."
fikret-mualla-saygi_unknown-title-9,amusement,There are several different types of people that make it amusing.  i like the bright colors.This looks like a very inexperienced artist.  funny looking people makes me laugh.It reminds me of an eccentric family portrait that captures the subjects individual personalities.
georges-braque_the-house-behind-the-trees-1906,amusement,The color pallette of pinks and greens and the way this is painted is funny to me looks like a child painted this.This has a simple and light theme with bright colors that enhance the scene.The colors and lines make this ordinary scene fun to look at.
james-ensor_masks-1938,amusement,"The people resemble clowns which is offputting but funny, the colors are very pastel and cheery.The characters are so happy; they look like cartoons, but their colors are so festive.The use of many colors helps to bring out the jovial scene and adds a sense of high class society.Just a fun little scene.Looks like a party is going on.The people look like court jesters.The large contrast of colors is fascinating."
john-duncan-fergusson_caf-concert-des-ambassadeurs-1907,excitement,"Reminds me of what you may see during a play.It feels like either a show, or a wedding.I am excited because the lack of facial features makes me imagine what the people would look like."
kazimir-malevich_bathers,disgust,"The men are naked, and out of shape.The wavy lines and greenish colors of the men's bodies make me feel grossed out.I don't like nakedness, even in art."
mary-fedden_minarets-1968,amusement,Reminds me of a child's painting.The crude style of the painting is funny.The contrast of the greens on the leaves is very pleasing.
mary-fedden_still-life-on-red-1976,amusement,"Looks like a pear shaped planet in the sky.The big fruit seems out of place in the horizon, but the contrast in color makes it interesting to look at.The sun with the fruit is an interesting combination.I feel like this fruit is happy to be sitting in the light of the sun."
pyotr-konchalovsky_picture-of-the-carpet-study-for-portrait-of-director-vsevolod-meyerhold-1938,something else,"Happy because of the bright colors and invitingness of the bed, it seems like a happy, upbeat place.This looks like a man lying in a bed with colorful blankets.Quite a bland pase depiction of a bed i think."
rik-wouters_portrait-of-mrs-giroux-1913,something else,"I'm put off a bit by the rather garish choices of color and an unfinished look.This strikes me as being a formal night at a ball, ballet or opera.I'm a bit confused by this image. i'm unsure if the woman is a woman or a man. i also find it interesting that there is a man in the background as well, as if they are waiting on them."
theo-van-doesburg_self-portrait-1911,sadness,"The man on the picture have a sad face, his eyes looks like tired and really sad. the blue background makes it even more sad.All of the color on the man's face seem to be hiding his sad expression.The despair in his eyes marks sure depression.The young man depicted looks morose and the unusual color palette used on his faces makes him seem pensive and sad."
viorel-marginean_unknown-title-2,excitement,"This makes me think the wind is blowing and leaves are flying everywhere, which makes me think of autumn.You rarely ever see green and red together this way in nature but the composition and detail of this piece make it exciting and interesting.Looks like a beautiful and colorful tree, the different color on the leaves are nice and the whole picture looks relax."

leonardo-da-vinci_head-of-st-james-the-less,sadness,"There are water marks dripping down modifying the artwork.Looking at the man’s face, he looks concerned like something is wrong.A person alone, with a longing, vacant look in his eyes.This man looks desperate and sad.He is looking forlornly at something in the distance. his mouth is curled down in a sad frown.The womans face and placement of her hands makes her appear sad and confused."
leonardo-da-vinci_studies-of-water-passing-obstacles-and-falling,disgust,"It looks like hair and then hair in water.Is that a bunch of earthworms on the plate?The picture just looks weird. i don't get it and it makes me think of something gross, like a hairball in a drain."

luca-signorelli_self-portrait-of-luca-signorelli-left,something else,"It makes me feel awkward and uncomfortable, due to the washed out colors and their uneasy expressions.This photo makes me feel nostalgic. it appears to be two men, perhaps a father and son. their outfits are modest and cover them well. the colors appear to be very matte and their faces show disgust, or perhaps fear.These two are 'mulling or ruminating' over something, wonder what that is?"
luca-signorelli_the-martyrdom-of-st-sebastian-1,sadness,"The unsettleness of a nation with icons.I feel sadness that christ was treated so poorly and shot with arrows.This picture make me feel sad because they are all crucifying him.This is a sad scene depicting judgement, pain, and death.Cruxification is sad to see, makes me upset."

michelangelo_the-fall-of-phaeton-1533,disgust,"The drawing is vulgar, people turned into trees, and animals, it's rather disturbing.The twisting cows and figures in the center remind me of human organs exposed to the air from a terrible wound.The combination of nude human and animal forms is disturbing, even more so as an uncolored line drawing."
pietro-perugino_madonna-of-consolation-1498,awe,"Perhaps this is the virgin mother mary and jesus. the child needs a diaper or there could be a mess here very soon.Everyone is worshipping the child and praying for him.Very distinct painting, bright colors and the angels make another awesome painting of mary and the christ child."

raphael_st-michael-1505,excitement,"I like the colors and the action in the image, the monsters look scary, the hero looks valiant and it really tells a story.Archangel michael slaying the demon is thrilling.  devils and imps crawl in submission before the mighty angel with his thick, heavy wings and upraised sword. the smoke of battle rises red in the background, and an army of angels musters behind michael.The exciting action of the figure with a sword battling a horrific creature."
raphael_the-death-of-ananias-cartoon-for-the-sistine-chapel,fear,"The older men are on the step calling out the rules, while the younger men enforce the rules with physical violence. the boys on the ground look like they do not know what they've done wrong.This looks like a dramatic scene where two men got into an argument which resulted in one of them getting hurt.Everyone is focused on the man on the ground - gives a sense of fear about what is happening to him."

titian_the-death-of-st-peter-martyr-1529,fear,The man attacking the other man is scary and it looks like he is going to kill them.The man on the floor looks like he's being attacked and the tree obscuring the moon looks foreboding.The warrior in this image looks like he is attacking two men who are pleading to be saved.
vittore-carpaccio_glorification-of-st-ursula-and-her-companions-1491,awe,"The detail in this painting is very impressive. you get the illusion of different angles with god being at the top, mary in the middle, and the women on the ground.The crowd of people all kneeling in praying and looking at the central figure and the glowing light and floating angels around the central figure make me feel the central figure is awesomely powerful and holy.The crowds surrounding christ give the viewer a sense of religious awe, as if he is redeeming us from our sins.This scene makes me feel amazing because the angelic presence is inspirational.This must be someone's vision of what it will be like in heaven with god above, the virgin mary and angels. the people are worshipping them."

vittore-carpaccio_three-studies-of-a-cavalier-in-armor,fear,The solider looks as they are riding on a ghost of another soilder.Seeing this disembodied soldier is quite frightening. it looks as if somebody just cut his leg off.The look on the face in the top right looks demonic.The person is slowly losing pieces of their own identity.
abdullah-suriosubroto_menuju-danau,sadness,It seems to me the man is lonely and lost in a jungle.The figure in the painting is dwarfed by the environment and seems to be isolated.The greenery and the shadows gives it a dark feeling.
antoine-blanchard_place-de-la-republique-2,sadness,"Looming gray clouds signal the end of a bustling day.The sky is quite gloomy and rain appears to be approaching.The day appears to be uneventful, but maybe too uneventful.The sky is dark and gray and the people all appear to be in their own world."
antoine-blanchard_theatre-des-varietes-large-1,excitement,The bustling scene and bright colors bring about an energy of excitement.This painting reminds me of downtown dublin during a rainstorm in the early 1900s.A couple walks together through a busy city street downtown.
arkhip-kuindzhi_a-birch-grove-1,fear,"The dark colors and scary appearances would not make me want to be here. the greens and blues are so dark they almost blend together.It has gotten late and now i fear being in this dark forest, must go where it is safe.The forest is dark and quiet and could be hiding almost anything.It's getting dark in the creepy forest, what is hiding behind those trees?"

childe-hassam_brelevenez-lannion-cote-du-nord-france,something else,The colors are the color of sickness and make me feel nauseous.I am disappointed by the lack of color scheme in the building.Very dull even with the bursts of color it has no eye catching sections.

cornelis-vreedenburgh_view-on-the-ij-in-amsterdam,sadness,"The dreary colors and lack of attention to detail of the boats makes it look that this is a dying community.A large ship is getting ready to sail off to sea for a long voyage.The openness of the composition, the huge sea, and the fact it is a port of some kind where people likely sailed off to never be seen again - makes me feel sad."
edgar-degas_after-the-bath-6,disgust,"There's something about this figure that seems almost not human, like it has fur rather than skin, and its crawling towards the person seated.The person in the picture appears naked and affraid.I can't tell what this is about, but it feels almost beastily."

edgar-degas_the-milliner,fear,"This makes me feel confused. i'm not sure what the man in the picture is doing, if the woman in the background is a sculpture or another figure. i believe he might be a hatter working on a hat, but i can't be sure. further, the way his face seems oddly detailed and realistic compared to the sketched lines of everything else is a bit scary.The man's grey face gives off a feeling of immenent death.The face looks almost realistic while everything else does not; that and the odd, dark colors makes this a bit creepy looking."

salvador-dali_es-poal-pianque-1920,something else,Looks like as soon as the painting was done it was doused in acid.It's hard to really tell what's going on here. it feels chaotic. maybe a body of water with buildings in the background? it seems like something big is happening i just can't tell what.What the heck is it... looks like a boat but those look like buildings behind it.... colors are dark and i'm cluesss as to what its supposed to be.
thalia-flora-karavia_portrait-of-a-man,something else,I find this picture interesting more than anything. the man looks thoughtful and reserved with just the right amount of detail in his face. i also like the way the artist signed the work.Hes a father doing his work at his desk by the light. reminds ne of another time.The lamp on the desk with the man writing gives a very serious feeling.
theo-van-rysselberghe_nude-from-behind-fixing-her-hair,excitement,"A woman stands with her back to you, naked and ready to go.I am excited by the way theartist has covered the nude's body with splotches of different colors.The bright colors catch my attention right away i see a woman about to get ready for a night out."
theodor-pallady_pe-cheiul-senei,something else,"There is a childish look to this image, definitely underwhelming.The colors are a bit bland and the objects are rudimentary. nothing in particular is felt.I do not find this work zone to be interesting, the people are also not well defined."
theophrastos-triantafyllidis_women-in-the-royal-garden-1937,sadness,"The colors of the painting are drab and drab and the people are faceless.The colors of the background and woman remind me of a sad time.It's very snowy on the ground, but the women still feel pressured to wear high heels."
umberto-boccioni_farmers-at-work-risaiole-1908,sadness,The pictures are not not well clear and feary.These women seem to have a lot of ground to cover to finish the work in this field.While the colors are bright the red around the people looks like they are bleeding from the hard work they are doing.
vanessa-bell_the-red-dress-1929,excitement,"I like the dreamy, peaceful look on this beautiful woman, plus her purple robe which offsets the red dress.Confetti is raining down all over this woman.I find this woman quite interesting and also quite attractive in a natural way.I am very excited by the woman's cloak, as well as her haughty look."
willard-metcalf_closing-autumn,awe,"The leaves look like they've been lit on fire since they're such a deep shade of dark orange.The orange and green colors look like fall in the mountains.I see such peacefulness and picture myself sitting in a chair reading a book while glimpsing at the blue water.I imagine there is a small village by the beautiful river, that they also fish in."
william-merritt-chase_a-corner-of-my-studio,awe,"I envision it as a very regal studio space, and i love a good community resource.Curious objects that i would love to look at and experience.The room and items look really extravagant and exclusive."
william-merritt-chase_portrait-of-mrs-william-merritt-chase,awe,The lady looks as if she is someone of stature given the elaborate jewelry she is wearing all over her body. it must be very expensive.This woman is dressed so beautifully and elegantly; so lovely to see.The womans green skirt reminds me of summer grass.
william-merritt-chase_prospect-park-brooklyn-02,awe,"Wow! the details are amazing. the painting looks like real.I love the details of the stonework and trees.  so much to see in the painting.The woman on the steps is like an aura, ethereal and ghost-like in the city park."
william-merritt-chase_shinnecock-hills-04,excitement,"I am excited by the lonely road leading to the horizon, and by the contrast between the dark mountains and the blue sky.This open pathway and sprawling landscape gives me a sense of adventure. like i want to explore.I like to travel and an open road through the countryside gets me a little bit excited."
william-merritt-chase_the-olive-grove,awe,There looks like there are almost two seasons in this photo which makes it look very interesting and impressive. especially as i could imagine wandering down this street and smelling the smells of fall and of spring.The silence and beauty of nature is the best.This path through cherry blossoms is wonderful.
winston-churchill_newbuildings-sussex-1921(1),something else,The bright garden beyond the dark hallway really beckons you. it feels allegorical.The blackness look like streams of black licorice.I have a curiosity and would want to follow the light to see where it leads to.
zinaida-serebriakova_winter-in-the-royal-village-upper-bath-1912,sadness,"The barren landscape and the empty trees make it seem so stark and lonely.The sculpture seems too stiff, as if it's been frozen in the snow.The lone statue surrounded by trees makes for a lonely sight.The house feels quite lonely in in the far away reaches of this work. the statue appears to be the only thing keeping the area company."
agnolo-bronzino_portrait-of-bia-de-medici-1542,amusement,"The girl's head is disproportionate to the rest of her body.The girl has a sneaky, impish look and her face as she looks off into the corner.She looks like a girl but has an older looking face."
correggio_christ-presented-to-the-people-ecce-homo(2),sadness,Everyone's got sad faces and i know jesus is about to get crucified.The people's faces look worried.The women is this painting are expressing sadness.Sad people with jesus and his crown of thorns.
el-greco_christ-carrying-the-cross,sadness,Its a picture showing suffering.Picture of jesus wearing a thorny crown.How can a guy that apparently brings the world so much joy be so sad himself?
el-greco_laocoon,fear,This is really strange to me. i think its religious on some level perhaps of the fallen ones.The skin tones are terrifying and very unsettling to look at.The snakes and dark background.
el-greco_st-francis-and-brother-rufus-1606,sadness,There is a use of colors that arouse a sensation in which the subjects are devoid of real meaning.There is a very grim like quality to the image and the subjects within it.The painting shows characters as very sad.
el-greco_st-mary-magdalene,awe,"The woman is literally larger than life, she looks like a giant but also has nice, beautiful features.The woman is beautiful, therefore i am in awe of her beauty.This painting has deep religious meaning."
el-greco_st-peter,sadness,This man has an expression of sorrow on his face.This man appears to be ill inside this picture.The face appears sad.
el-greco_st-sebastian-1,sadness,The detail of the arrows in his skin.There is very dismal quality to the way death is portrayed.He has multiple wounds and looks hurt.
el-greco_the-dream-of-philip-ii-1579,fear,"There is fear when looking at this as if someone is coming out of the sky to judge those below.The image is powerful and shows a strong sense of dread in the world it portrays.This has burning colors with an obvious distinction of those above and those below who are begging looking desperately upward, made with a clashing business across the image."
giorgio-vasari_abraham-and-the-three-angels,awe,The framing is very interesting to watch.Awe struck is what i feel as do the subjects in the artwork.I feel informed and educated with this intellectual and historical portrait.
giorgio-vasari_clement-vii-crowns-charles-v,awe,The vivid colors inspire me.An example of what the times were like in the past.All must bow down to the lord.
giorgio-vasari_the-deposition,sadness,"The man has been injured, possibly mortally, and it looks like he's being cradled by a mother-figure.This photo makes me feel sad. the image depicted here shows people who may not be happy or be their best.Because the young man appears to be deceased and everyone is mourning him.It appears that the person being held is sick or dying.He looks like he is dying and they seem worried."
giuseppe-arcimboldo_winter-1573(1),amusement,I am amused because his head is made out of plants.Funny subject nose makes me laugh.  good use of color and great details.Awesome depiction of woodland creature with natural materials.
hans-von-aachen_the-judgment-of-paris-1588,awe,Goddesses at play.A man seems to be forming a bond with a woman who he is interested in and bystanders and angles gather to witness the spectacle.It's a passionate scene where the characters are exhibiting a lot of movement and emotion.
hans-von-aachen_the-three-graces-1604,something else,I find it weird. so i'm not sure what to say.Irritation is what i feel.  naked women paintings are really cliche to me.This makes me feel lusty.
jacopo-pontormo_seated-nude-with-raised-arm,disgust,Looks like a lot is going sexually in this picture which doesnt bother me but their buttocks kind of are ugly.I feel discuss the way the bodies are bending looks very uncomfortable it is also not very flattering.A wrinkly old behind is very uncomfortable to look at.
maerten-van-heemskerck_colossus-of-rhodes,excitement,"As a avid researcher of alternative histories, i find this painting very exciting, as if it is depicting a part of history we may not have previously understood.Legend is brought to life.Holy giants and little people that honor them.  i knew we'd be reminded one day that we were relatives."
paolo-veronese_aristotle,awe,I had trouble deciding if this was a painting or a sculpture.  the shadows are remarkable.The detail is something to be amazed about.The rapt expression on this man's face hidden in his dark little enclave in the bright room are remarkable.
paolo-veronese_boy-with-a-greyhound,amusement,Men's clothing of this time period is very unusual and amusing.This painting makes me feel amusement because the dog looks like he is wanting to go chase something or move and the man is standing holding him back.Because the man in this portrait is wearing the most ridiculous feminine clothing while standing next to a very manly breed of dog.
paolo-veronese_girl-in-the-doorway-1561,amusement,"Girl looking around in a playful way.The girl in the image seems to be playing or peeking into a room she shouldn't be which could be amusing.The girl has a curious expression on her face, and i wonder what she is looking at."
paolo-veronese_holy-family-with-sts-anthony-abbot-catherine-and-the-infant-john-the-baptist-1551,something else,"The people are solemn, but perched so interestingly on the pillars it is quite interesting.The child standing on the edge makes me feel nervous.The picture reminds me of ancient biblical times era."
paolo-veronese_jesus-healing-the-servant-of-a-centurion,fear,"The blackened skies, the horse tilting his head, and the old man pleading indicate that this is a worrisome scene.The man being held by the two men seems scared to approach the man with outstretched arms.The dark black sky and soldiers with spears is scary and threatening."
paolo-veronese_mars-and-venus-united-by-love,disgust,This painting makes me think a male painted it because the man is the only one with clothes on.The woman without clothes engenders thoughts of gratuitous nudity.It seems like the nudity of the woman is unneccessary and gratuitous.
paolo-veronese_moderation-1582,awe,"This is very interesting. it makes me wonder if the frame is simply painted that way to make an optical illusion, or if this is an actual frame made in this shape. either way, it's a nice effect. the deep blue of the sky compliments the coppery colors.The painting of the frame inside the picture is brilliant. the gold colors are perfect for it.The picture frame within the painting is a very effective addition and draws the eye."
paolo-veronese_the-triumph-of-mordecai-1556,fear,"The horses look scared, maybe becuase of the battle to come?The painting is busy with war-like action, which makes me fearful for the safety of everyone involved.This painting is war like and looks like people are fighting."
paolo-veronese_venus-and-amor,amusement,The look on her face and the child seems a bit funny to me.The artist caught the subjects embarrassment of being caught a mess breastfeeding the baby and no longer feels her man will find her as sexually attractive.The woman's breast is exposed while a cherub cuddles her.
parmigianino_madonna-with-the-long-neck-1540,awe,"A mother touching her heart shows enduring love as her child grows older.The painting looks majestic, and classic, like a virgin mary.The way the mother is holding her baby and looking at him or her makes me feel love."
tintoretto_annunciation-maria-1594,awe,Blessed mary leaning forward in supplication. the colors are dreamy and angelic and she seems very soulful and pious.The art style is really pretty and the woman reading in the picture has an angelic look to her.The figure appears to be having a heartfelt emotion.
tintoretto_the-annunciation-to-manoah-s-wife-1558,awe,The colors and characters of this painting are masterfully crafted in there detailed facial expressions.I feel in awe about the seated woman and standing girl outdoors while the sun peaks through the clouds.The colors are so bright as the sky opens up and brings joy to the women.
tintoretto_the-battle-of-zara,sadness,"This looks like a war scene where many men are being killed or hurt.The painting shows the worst effects war has on populations.A gruesome battle with weapons which is painted in black and white, making it even more sad. you can see dead bodies lying there, and people and horses just about to get stabbed."
tintoretto_the-conversion-of-saul,fear,The dark colors and the crowded painting look a bit scary.It looks like a battle scene where no one is winning and everyone is falling.The scene is chaotic and the people and animals appear to be confused and injured.
tintoretto_the-evangelists-mark-and-john-1557,awe,Strong and powerful feeling. also i feel like there is intelligence and witt.The artist is very detailed the picture looks very lifelike.These two young men are hard at work creating what looks to be art.
tintoretto_the-worship-of-the-golden-calf,excitement,There a ton of people in the pictrue so it feels dynamic.There are so many people in this painting that it makes the scene look frenzied.Many people are gathering in anticipation of a big meeting ahead.
titian_christ-carrying-the-cross,something else,"The eye communication between the men reminds jesus he will assend.Compassion. a man running to lighten that man's burden. it is sadness, love, pain and sacrifice.Way that the man is carrying the cross with the other man leaning on the cross makes you think of the added stress or things we carry on ourselves from others."
titian_diana-and-callisto-1559,awe,"I love the realism in the people and the dramatic colors, they're incredible.The nude man has an arrow in his hand.At first glance i would say this looks like a wild sex party but it looks free, open, and non judgemental."
titian_pentecost,awe,The white bird and shining light are central to the image. the poses of the people and their facial expressions all guide toward this light.The spectacular rays of light shining down on the worshipping people come from god symbolized by the dove.The light spilling down is quite inspiring to me.
titian_philipp-ii-as-prince-1551,amusement,The way the guy is dressed makes it amusing.Why those silly shorts?  the outfit is ridiculous.It's hard to get past my amusement that he's not wearing full pants like nobody's going to call him fancy pants! but i'd love to see this fully vibrant like when it was first painted it's so regal and formal.
titian_tarquin-and-lucretia-1576,anger,I can see the fear in this picture with the womans face and the knife being held by the man.This appears to be a woman being violated in the worst way.The man looks like he is trying to attack the woman.
agnes-martin_on-a-clear-day-1-1973,something else,"A blank grid does not make me feel anything.Someone forgot to make some art.This piece is quite boring, it reminds me of graph paper used in math class."
agnes-martin_untitled-1977-2,something else,"Annoying, make  me state hard to see the shades.Looks like a boring painting with dull grays and yellows.It's difficult to believe this is presented as a 'painting' - it looks as though someone photographed a piece of cloth. there is almost nothing to it - pale pink, gray, blue & mustard looking colored stripe.  weird, strange painting."
agnes-martin_untitled-1994,sadness,"The sparseness of it is a little depressing.Not sure why it makes me feel sad when i see it just looks blah.Blankness, but also texture in the sameness."
alighiero-boetti_immaginando-tutto-1982,something else,"Curious, i wonder if this is spelling something out and it makes me want to figure out what the message is, if so.Interesting. this one is a little confusing to me.  feels like a code is displayed throughout the boldness of color. divided but whole.It makes me feel blah.I do not feel anything from this."
andrei-cadere_six-round-wooden-bars-1975,amusement,"Multi colored poles as artwork, at least they are different colors and patterns than the first one in the corner.It is amusing to try and figure out what the objects in the image are supposed to be, straws?Colorful but just looks like drumsticks.Looks like child toys."
anne-truitt_30-july-1973-1973,something else,"This is just too light and bland for my liking.I feel stupid. i think this looks like i have dumped my printer paper. i hope it does not get bent on the edges and become useless.It makes me feel calm because its neutral.This is my one i feel nothing painting.  almost looks like a blank canvas and is hard to seem the small white design.  it almost looks like office papers on my desk.No feelings when looking at this, very plain and dull."
brice-marden_for-caroline-1977,something else,"I am confused as to why the lines are laid out the way they are.I feel like it's attracting my eyes in strange directions with the contrast.Makes me feel bored with only 2 colors.Simple.  black and white.  rigid, no bending the rules.  you either do you or don't."
brice-marden_nebraska-1966,sadness,"Sad because its so basic.Sadness, it's just a dull color blue.  it's kind of a sad color, it reminds me of the hospital.Sad.  very sad.  nothingness.  blue.It's gray, nothing but a solid square of gray, like one little snapshot of the side of a navy ship."
bruce-nauman_perfect-door-perfect-odor-perfect-rodo-1972,amusement,"It is interesting to see the different words they created with the letters.The bright colors and context are funny.It's a bit boring, but clever at the same time.I find the different ways to use the letters d,o,o,r is very amusing.The letter arrangements are amusing to me."
david-batchelor_hackney-road-drawing-2004,excitement,The blackness being consumed by colors.The bright colors radiating from the shapes are exciting.The contrast between the black and the bright colors is exciting.
ellsworth-kelly_square-form-1951,something else,"I feel curiosity because the black square is like a window, and i'm curious what is beyond the darkness.Intrigued.  what does it mean?Curious.  what is it?"
eva-hesse_hang-up-1966,something else,It makes me uncomfortable to suspend my normal mental processing.Bored.  ugly.It makes me feel like something is missing due to the empty frame.
fernando-lanhas_untitled,something else,I am left confused by the lack of content.Reminds me of maybe a map.It makes me bored looking at it.I find this very boring. just a bunch of lines doing nothing. bland colors and no excitement.
fred-sandback_untitled-wall-construction-1985,something else,"I am confused as to what the artist was going for.A very simple abstract.The photo is abstract and is plain.I feel nothing, the three lines in the photo just look like lines on a wall."
gene-davis_untitled-1972,something else,I feel agitated by all the lines in the middle. it's almost like staring at a tv screen full of static.This image lacks any depth or skill in its creation.I feel nothing. it blank with nothing of interest for me to focus on or to be moved by.
jean-degottex_chattigraphie-1974,something else,"This makes me anxious, looks like a math problem.I feel confusion it seems like i am looking at some kind of code it is very mysterious.Kooky, quirky, radical,  avant-garde painting.This is an interesting picture, on first glance it seems a bit bland but there is something comforting about the simplicity of the triangles against the harsh brush strokes of the text.The negative space makes me feel blank and empty inside."
jean-degottex_depli-bleu-ii-1979,something else,This photo does not make me feel any way. it is not very artistic and makes me feel confused. it is just a few blue lines that make me feel there is still a lot to be desired.This brings about confusion.It's nothing but blue llines on a white background.
jean-degottex_depli-graphite-v,something else,"The drawing makes me feel bored as it reminds me of something a child would do when bored in school.This makes me feel like a child could do this. because of how simple the image it, i don't get much feeling and feel the lack of substance takes away from the piece.Sunstroke at the beach.I am not sure if this did not load right, but i am confused."
jean-degottex_media-vii,sadness,"The image makes me feel terribly lonely since it is gray and very dreary looking.Another painting of the void the dark colors the nothingness.The colors are drab, boring and look like tears falling.It's a black image and is like death."
jean-degottex_untitled-2,something else,"This picture makes me feel absolutely nothing because there is no color used and the only thing that is present is a blank canvas. i guess maybe it is so that the viewer can project whatever feelings that they want to onto the canvas, but it does nothing for me.Bored, seems like a bad copy off a machine.I can't tell if this is a painting or the back of a painting.The blankness of the image with minimal details."
jiro-yoshihara_untitled(2),something else,"It's just a black painted circle on canvas. i don't really know what i'm suppose to be getting from this.This painting seems kind of boring as it's just a picture of an ""o"".What the? puzzled on what this is supposed to be."
joan-hernandez-pijuan_four-pears-with-color-scale-1977,something else,"The shades of gold to dark green is a nice contrast to the black and white penciled apple.Feels like i am viewing a color wheel and basic art class sketches.While this painting is somewhat boring,  the detail of the pair is fantastic."
john-mccracken_blue-block-in-three-parts-1966,something else,"A blue box is perplexing. there is no purpose to it.I wouldn't define a photo of a blue square shape cushion or crate as art, very off the wall.These blue little square things do nothing for me, not interesting at all. no story behind it."
john-mccracken_portal-1989,something else,"Confusion; not sure what this is supposed to be.Simplistic and minimalist, the blue is a good contrast to the background.A photograph of a blue board or some kind of material against the wall, isn't art. very moronic."
john-mclaughlin_number-15-1961,something else,Confusion i dont understand the color combinations.This picture is very basic and it does not hold my attention for long.This make me feel like blank.
john-mclaughlin_number-17-1962,something else,"This made me feel confused because i do not understand the message the painting is trying to get across.Bored. this is nothing special and looks like a printer jammed and they pulled it out improperly.It reminds me of a black book with red binding, it is boring."
keith-sonnier_neon-wrapping-incandescent-1969,amusement,Strangely attractive and must be better viewing this in the dark.It is fun to see a cute picture from something not foreign to the common home.This looks like a little alien dancing to music.
lee-ufan_dialogue-2008,something else,Bored.  the composition is sterile and austere.  it looks like an aluminum wastebasket.The negative space and one object in the painting is very boring.This could be a simple teacup setting in the void of infinity.
li-yuan-chia_folding-scroll-1963,something else,Confustion. what is this painting trying to portray with the red and eyeballs?Bored this is lifless and im not sure what the point is.The large white dot looks like a tiny shell from the beach.
park-seo-bo_ecriture-no-960714-1996,something else,Totally black canvas. its not mysterious or eerie just gimmicky and rather stupid.The textures in the painting make it look like a piece of fabric.The overlapping rectangular shapes reminds me of tile roofing and doesn't really spark much thought beyond that.
pat-lipsky_for-leslie-1974,disgust,"The squares make me feel like im lost.It reminds me of a bathroom floor, and that is gross.Varying shades of grey geometric tiles with nothing else are boring."
piero-manzoni_achrome-1959-2,anger,It makes me angry that someone thought this could be art.This isn't even artwork when you look at it and that makes me upset.I thought this was a napkin at first look. what is this part of wall paper? this is not good at all.
pino-pinelli_pittura-n-4-1994,amusement,"It looks like cheese and chocolate arranged in a specific format.Not sure if this is a modified yin and yang or a deformed bumblebee!This reminds me of a pittsburgh sports team because they have the same colors, i like how they don't really fit into each other. kind of ying and yang almost."
ralph-hotere_towards-aramoana-drawing-for-a-black-window-1981,something else,"Interested. is the note in the bottom right corner the same note depicted on the easel/window? what does it mean? intentionally random?I don't really understand what the painting is supposed to be but it looks like theres a picture of a city in the back.I find this one a little confusing. trying to discern what i am looking at with so many motifs combined. otherwise, it would make a good modern art piece to form a room's decor around.It seems unfinished and confusing and i'm not sure what this is."
richard-serra_untitled-14-part-roller-drawing-1973,something else,"The black square on a plain background is boring.I don't get why a black square is suppossed to be art. i just don't get it.There is no color in the picture, it is boring."
richard-tuttle_3rd-rope-piece-1974,something else,"Looks like a boring piece of rope.The white string looks unappealing and out of place.Interest.  it is just a small length of twine, but the texture seems to pop out against the solid white background.  it is strangely compelling to look at the patterns in the twine and the slightly frayed ends.A piece of braided white rope nailed to a grayish-white background generates a sense of indifference in something that is questionable as art."
richard-tuttle_sum-confluence-1964,something else,"The image looks like it could potentially be a corporate logo - gives a sense of curiosity of what it stands for.I feel confused when i see this painting. i feel it is a symbol i should recognize., especially since it is all green, like it has to do with saving the environment.Makes me think what a waste of wood, environmental issues just for art."
richard-tuttle_water-1965,amusement,The blue pants looks like jeans my parents would wear.The shape looks like an upside down pair of blue pants.It reminds me of sesame street and their letter of the day.The blue v-shape reminds me of an inverted pair of denim jeans.
robert-mangold_104-perimeter-series,something else,"This painting makes me feel nothing, except confused, because there is no image in the painting.There  are two empty rectangles and they don't seem to being too much.This looks like a blanc piece of paper and it really does nothing for the imagination.The plain image with just the square evokes a feeling of ""almost emptiness"". you wonder what the one thing is keeping you from the emptiness."
robert-ryman_rule-1991,something else,"It looks like a piece of ver plain ceramic tile.This painting looks bland and i am confused by it.I feel disappointed when i see this.  there is little i can draw from, little i can hold in my mind.  i wont remember this, i wont reflect on it.  i am disappointed to see this."
robert-ryman_untitled-from-seven-aquatints,something else,"I feel neutral and slightly confused about this because its just a cream colored square on a white background.There's nothing but a dull looking color covering most of the painting.A blank white square, doesn't really make me feel any way because i just see white on white."
rodolfo-arico_untitled-1988,something else,"The blue square looks as if is just a piece of cloth.The geometric shapes look like scraps of paper left over from doing a crafts project, it evokes a sense of tedium.The blue color and just a box does not bring me in any direction.  this has no emotion or feel that comes from this painting."
walter-de-maria_square-1972,something else,"The sterling silver ball in the rails makes me intrigued with how it will be used, utter confusion.A plan white marble foundation on a floor of white marble is depressing. empty white squares in a sea of white squares, this makes me think of a typical office building with its bland architecture, and the corporate american desire for mindless sheep to fill jobs. one more empty square in a universe of empty squares - deflated and numbed to reality.This is boring and utilitarian, and brings no emotions."
yves-klein_untitled-blue-monochrome-1957-2,anger,"This is considered art work and it is so much nothingness it makes me angry.I like a picture that says something and this shows nothing.It is just a blue square.  i don't like paintings that don't have some sort of scene being portrayed in them.  or, at least, i would like a combination of different colors."
andre-bauchant_animals-crossing-a-flooded-river-with-a-distant-waterfall-1924,awe,"While the water looks too artificial, the trees in the picture are very verdant and realistic, which i find impressive. the waterfall also impresses me.How nature can be calm.Animals in a natural , serene setting."
andre-bauchant_quatre-amours-dans-les-fleurs-1930,amusement,Because it reminds of being a playful child.Kids running in greenly grasses are playful.Looks like they are having fun.
andre-bauchant_unknown-title,awe,"The brightness in the colors of the flowers.The flowers in this pieces draw the eyes to the center and makes the viewer focus on the flowers, but then looking at the surrounding landscape and details gives an appreciation for how vast this painting is and the effort it took to paint it.Amazing exaggerated details that are incredibly realistic.  beautiful color and textures."
andre-derain_golden-age,fear,"It feels like a fight between man and lion.The humans are outnumbered by the animals, which look bigger than the humans. i am concerned for the wellfare of the humans.The lions seem hungry for the humans."
camille-bombois_the-white-horse-1920,amusement,"Both the situation, some sort of a circus performance, but also the jolly pink colors and the smiles on the audience's faces.I can't imagine a person being able to stand on a horse like this.This one is interesting, its very whimsical.There is an active scene of a man on a horse at a circus; circus' are bright, loud and there's a lot going on.I see the humor in the painting with the dressed man with a duck in a basket balancing on the back of a horse."
david-burliuk_couple-in-a-landscape,disgust,It looks like a pile of vomit and blood and mangled limbs.Looks like trash to me.The faces on the top right seem like smeared feces.
david-burliuk_cowboy-in-the-organ-mountains-new-mexico-1949(1),awe,"Colorful, sunny painting full of life.The choice of red and yellow are wonderfully to look at.I love the way the pink stands out in this photo, as this is not a color you would find naturally in new mexico."
david-burliuk_man-and-cow,fear,It looks like the devil.I think the creature wants to eat me.Looks like a man talking to a bull head.

david-burliuk_to-get-one-kiss-he-uses-two-keys,amusement,"This guy has two faces! so cool!His two faces are amusing, though i don't fully understand what is happening.This painting is really intriguing, im not sure what the artist is trying to convey with the two headed man, it makes you really curious looking at this painting."
david-burliuk_woman-with-two-buckets,amusement,Beautiful scenery and the fact that there is animals in weird colours amuses me.I am amused at the humorous colors of the horses.The colors of the animals is really odd and unusual.
fernand-leger_not_detected_196071,amusement,"The colors seem bold and lively, like they would match well with the fun, upbeat music this trio is about to play.Brightness of the colors against dark.The bright yellow background against the blue players is very pleasant and the men are amusing looking to me."
fernand-leger_pylons-study-for-the-city,amusement,Looks like a child drew this. very cartoon like.The cows look whimsical and the clouds look somewhat like the cows!I like the childlike nature to the painting. it looks like it has been coloured and drawn by a child which makes me feel amused.
fernand-leger_the-singer-on-the-radio,excitement,The colors are bold and loud like the woman appears to be.Reminds me of the old style mircophones.There is a lot of energy with the singer.
fernando-botero_dance-in-colombia,excitement,Reminds me of a painting someone may put up on their wall.People are enjoying the music and dancing.The painting looks like a party with a band and dancing.
fernando-botero_family,amusement,"This is an usual way of looking at the rich with their small heads and big bodies.  it's like the artist looks at them with small minds and fat nourished bodies.It's one thing that the adults are out of proportion, but the way the children are is done in such a ridiculously exagerrated way, it's funny.It looks like an animated giant family."
fernando-botero_picador,amusement,"The sizes and shapes look cartoonish.Everything is so misshapen in a cool funny way. the guy is small and large on a small horse with an even smaller head and the colors are very cool.The man looks perhaps too large for the pony and it's funny.I immediately started singing ""fat guy in a little coat"" when this popped onto my screen. why is that horse so small? why is that horse's  head so small?? why is the chin strap for the guy's hat not on his chin? also, i feel a little anxious because the horse is blindfolded."
fernando-botero_portrait-of-a-family,amusement,"I love the proportions and facial expressions, very whimsical.The shape of the people is quite funny and their kid next to them is also pudgy and they made me laugh.The relationships among the family members, and the ways they are individually depicted, is unique and interesting.Now this is what a family should be."
fernando-botero_still-life,excitement,It seems like the food is very celebratory in nature.A feast for all to enjoy.The food on the table looks like it would be delicious.
fernando-botero_the-sisters,amusement,"The women and the cats could be twins to each other due to their plumpness, expressions on their faces, and the colors of the women's dresses and cat's fur.The girth and expression s of these women and their cats is comical.The overfed figures are begging for ridicule, the colors mildly laughing.They are comically curvy."
fernando-botero_the-street-1987,amusement,The proportions of the people are odd and funny.The color choices pop while being warm at the same time and the style gives character to the villagers.I like the happy fat people in the pretty town.  makes me smile.The proportions of the figures are odd and funny.
fernando-botero_walk-in-the-hills,amusement,"The man makes me think of a giant mushroom.Hate these paintings. i get that this is a religious figure, which is subject matter i enjoy, but please just draw a man with normal sized features.The face on this guy makes me chuckle."
fernando-botero_woman,sadness,This made me sad because she seems like a child and yet they have her painted in poor taste and her face looks bloated more then the rest of her making me think she might be ill as well.The girl's expression is sad and she shouldn't be nude.This naked child looks confused and her features are embellished for comedic effect. sad.
grandma-moses_not_detected_251657(1),something else,"The idea of the picture is good, like a little colorful village.An amish yard sale. the detail of the house is nice, but everything else is boring and vague.A cozy neighborly feeling in this painting of somebody moving in (or out) of a house with their neighbors' help back in pioneering days."
grã©goire-michonze_figures,fear,One woman with bulging eyes is fainting while an old lady is clutching her heart in distress.Everyone in the painting seems to be suffering and need help.The men in brown and salmon look like they are attaxking the others!These people look like they are in the aftermath of a tragedy.
henri-rousseau_exotic-landscape-1908,amusement,"This stylized piece is very fanciful in nature and features much flora and fauna surrounded by vibrance.This is something a child would enjoy. the use of simple lines and bright colors makes this piece stand out.The young monkey smiles as he hides within the plants with his friends, but dad looks a bit worried."
henri-rousseau_portrait-of-a-man-1905,amusement,"The shape and figure of this subject is very dramatic.This piece made me laugh because the guy in the painting looks like rowan atkinson the guy that played mr bean.His facial features are funny, like the big nose, bushy eyebrows and red lips."
ivan-generalic_landleben-1985,amusement,"The use of overlapping and scale to gain perspective is an hilarious failure.Two giants set and enjoy some music next to some little people who are working.The change in size between the subjects is amusing, and the pop take on the colors is very pretty."
jean-hugo_constant-idoux,amusement,"At first, it looks like a realistic portrait, but that centaur in the middle threw me off.Interesting painting, especially the centaur in the center of the painting chasing the cow.Bright indigo in the top and the simple shapes. reminds me of an old kids cartoon."
jules-lefranc_morlaix-brume-matinale-1943,awe,"A painting that lets one step back in time with a historic scene filled with tranquil colors and a clean appearance.It amazes me the ship could sail so closely to such large buildings, and yet the design of it is immaculate.The color of the water and the reflection are beautiful."
kazimir-malevich_we-went-from-the-kovno-1914,amusement,"This reminds me of a cartoon scene and is cheerful.I am amused because of the rudimentary qualities of the painting.  the cannonballs, soldier, and hills all look like they could have been drawn by a junior high student in a mandatory art class.The smiling face on this man makes him look like he is very happy at whatever he is seeing.The whole picture seems funny. the horse looks like he is smiling and the man looks funny."
lyonel-feininger_trumpeter-trompeter-1918,amusement,Though the black lines are stark the character and toy(?) look playful and whimsical.The man seems to be much bigger than the city he is standing in.A giant standing over a village is really interesting.The man looks funny as he holds onto an object.I see a giant getting ready to play a brass instrument for a village below.It makes me think of a giant weight lifter.
marc-chagall_a-man-with-thora-1975,fear,"The dark colors and shadows make the man look like he is bothering the woman and child.Dark and brooding, and the expressions on the faces of the woman and child suggest the man is a dirtbag.The dark, distorted figures and heavy use of blacks look foreboding."

marc-chagall_creation-1980,excitement,"The sketches are fun and whimsical around the naked figure.The way the figures intermingle is fun and interesting.This scene looks sexual, since the woman is nude and her breasts are showing."
marc-chagall_david-1956-1,disgust,"This painting is very crude, and it is difficult to ascertain what the subject is doing. it does appear that he is holding a human head in his hand, which is rather gruesome. it looks like a child drew this picture.Holding a head of a decapitation is just sick.It is terrible. looks like he is holding another head but whoever drew this is 5 years old."
marc-chagall_david-and-bathsheba-1956,something else,"My primary feeling is that i don't like this painting. it looks like they are trying to show duplicity, such as man/woman, angel/devil, but i just don't like the style.This painting gives the confusion of identity.Makes me feel confused because there is a face on the side of a face and strange things on on the top of its head."
marc-chagall_eliezer-and-rebecca-1931,amusement,"It is so crudely drawn that it makes me think my little niece has created artworks of way higher caliber than this, and i wonder who decides what is going to be expensive art.The monkey riding the camel is funny and ironic.Simple art style, and the faces of the subjects look funny."
marc-chagall_elijah-resurrects-the-son-of-the-widow-of-zarephath-i-kings-xvii-17-22,sadness,The dark colors and woman in bed remind me of death.I see a woman grieving a loved one who is ill and possibly dying.A woman seems to be crying at the death of a woman on the bed.
marc-chagall_in-front-of-the-picture-1963,something else,Surprised that this is chagall- obviously just a study and not his usual good work in my opinion...Thick lines and white space make me feel confused.I feel confused because the picture looks like a jumble of lots of different ideas.Whimsy. juxtaposition. the seriousness of an abstract painting overlaid with the randomness of seemingly unrelated objects and things.
marc-chagall_isaiah-s-oracle-on-the-ruins-of-babylon-isaiah-xiii,fear,All the dead people on the ground and the dark colors is grim.The dark sky and bodies of the dead make me fearful of what has happened and what will happen next.The figure on the top looks like it is shrieking. there appears to be a battle scene. it is scary.
marc-chagall_joseph-is-attacked-and-robbed-by-his-brothers-genesis-xxxvii-23-24,sadness,"The dead man's face has a fixed gaze of horror as does that of the men watching.The man is being attempted to bury alive.Are they burying this man alive?  why are they stripping him?The man at the center looks like he's being humiliated, since others are stripping him of his clothes and thus his dignity.The subject matter seems upsetting, something bad is happening in this picture based on the expressions. the goats are smiling though?"
marc-chagall_moses-receiving-the-tablets-of-law,fear,"This man is trying to reach out from beyond the grave to warn others about his mistakes.The black and white is very striking but the main figure in this is a little scary.The figure on the left looks to be a terrifying ruler, and the darkened shadows further amplify this.It looks like demons flying towards gravestones or souls."
marc-chagall_moses-spreads-death-among-the-egyptians-1931,fear,"Appears to be a scene of death and destruction with the main person being of jewish origin reaching his hands towrd god in pleading.I feel like he is raising his hands in despair for something that he and his need.  i feel for him.Reminds me of a zombie trying to capture me,scary."
marc-chagall_moses-with-the-burning-bush-4,amusement,That angel is buff and on fire and the old man in green is so indifferent its great.They have such bright and distinct personalities through the colors chosen for the art.The simplicity of the sketches and the inexact application of color make it look like a rough draft..
marc-chagall_selifan,amusement,"The way that it is sketched, it looks like a child drew it. the man is very overexaggerated.The awkward-looking mechanic works on a carousel horse.Both the man and horse look like they were drawn by children."
marc-chagall_solomon-is-proclaimed-a-king-of-israel-i-kings-i-32-40,excitement,The soliders celebrate their leader in the homecoming scene.At first i thought this was a battle scene but as i looked again it appears to be a celebration of the return of the guy on the horse.The king has come home on his horse and the people are ecstatic.The horns and upraised arms around the crowned figure make it feel like a triumphant procession.
marc-chagall_the-story-of-the-rooster-the-little-goat-3,something else,"I feel confused. not sure the meaning of the rooster. the lady looks scary and dark.A somewhat biblical book that is in a foreign language.This appears to be a book, so i am unsure what to say."

maria-primachenko_black-beast-1936,excitement,"This painting is certainly of flight into fantasy.  the strange creatures really catch your attention.  i love the circular shapes on the black creature.I love the monster, or maybe it's a dinosaur, it's very original and not like anything i've ever seen before.I love this painting. it's incredibly unique and interesting."
maria-primachenko_black-monkey-1936,amusement,"The colors and spacing remind me of a quilt or fabric sample. it's colorful and fun and silly. makes me happy.I cannot tell what type of animal this is, but it looks incredibly hilarious.This looks like a designer bag patterned monkey."

maurice-prendergast_village-against-purple-mountain,amusement,"This reminds me of a finger painting that my small children would bring home.Although this is probably a 6+ figure work of art, it feels amateurish to me like a fingerpainting from a 5 year old.The bright, yet dark fall colors used for the tree's and background give me warmth."
natalia-goncharova_liturgy-the-seraph-s-costume,amusement,"A man is trying to fly in his cape that has 2 pictures of 4-eyed people.The person in the center literally has eight eyes watching their back.The bright colors, the precise, sharp lines and shapes, the many eyes, and how it all floats.The colors are bright and the faces and feet are amusing.A funny painting that resembles a disney world movie."

otto-gustav-carlsund_dresdens-spektrum-spader-dam-1922,amusement,"The makes me feel happy and reminds me of playing poker with friends in guam.This is a stay at home mothers game card, i can totally relate.The queen of spades wields a bucket and a scrub-brush?  if is an amusing juxtaposition between our expectations of someone whose face would be on a card, and the person in the piece of art in front of me.  i chuckled a little.The cartoon like woman dressed in rust and black clothes on a playing card? a brush and bucket at the top of the card is she gambling in her head whether she will clean today?"
pavel-filonov_landscape-with-two-animals,amusement,"The way the picture is drawn reminds me of current day cartoons.When you look closer things on the farm look too big or out of place.I'm amused by what i'm seeing , how the picture looks good made from charcoal."
raoul-dufy_boats-in-le-havre-1926,excitement,"So much activity here, it's watching the democracy process of the bigger and stronger taking it all in action.This painting reminds me of picasso's starry night.All the boats look like they are about to start a race."
raoul-dufy_gladioli-1942,something else,"I feel peacefulness while looking at the many colors of the plant in the painting.This is as standard picture of a bokay of flowers, pretty boring.Happy- i love flowers and the colors are soft and subtle providing a happy relaxed feeling. there are gladiolas in this picture and i love them.I feel indifferent. it reminds me of the older watercolor thank you notes, which i really wasn't fond of, but seemed to be popular."
seraphine-louis_unknown-title,awe,"Lots of color and movement in this painting makes me think of windy, spring days.Looking at this i cant get over the bold colors and how you really have to look to see if its a bird or a branch with alot of leaves on it. i like the little bird almost hidden under the big bush.A tree with leaves of a million colors. the colors are wondrous and the painting looks joyous."

edward-hopper_drug-store-1927,amusement,"Of all the things to advertise, this artist chose ex-lax.Well its an old ex lax advertisement on a drugstore window. i think its kind of neat.The subject is nostalgic and amusing.  the contrast of colors, the lights and darks that depict a street corner at night is interesting."
edward-hopper_study-of-a-seated-woman,sadness,"She just looks so sad and forlorn.The woman looks to be sad.I feel sad for the woman in this picture, as she looks angry.  it's possible she's angry about how ugly her dress is. the diagonal lines also depict anger to me."
john-french-sloan_the-city-from-greenwich-village-1922,excitement,"I love this exciting 1920s ny city scene. even without the caption it would have invoked ""vintage new york"" feelings in me.Trains are always exciting.Love this! i love trains. i love el trains even more. this takes me back to my early 20s when i lived by the el in phila. this picture brings back such great memories!"
john-french-sloan_the-new-blue-dress-1913,something else,"The woman in this painting makes me feel that she is pensive.I feel calm because the individual in the painting appears calm, relaxed and in control of the situation she's currently in.The subject doesn't seem comfortable.  i don't see joy, i only see worry and anxiety."
john-french-sloan_yellow-rock-gloucester-1915,awe,"Te contrast of the colors of the water and the rocks and the overall theme is awe inspiring.This style of painting feels messy, yet at the same time beautiful.This makes me so happy. it reminds me of home but when i'm not working and enjoying the beach and the rocks."

albrecht-durer_arm-of-lucretia,fear,"The heavy black shading feels ominous. the angle of the blame suggests self-harm.This makes me think the artist was angry at someone, possibly all o humanity.The person is holding a weapon and looks like he is going to either hurt himself or someone else."
albrecht-durer_christ-appears-to-his-mother-1511,awe,Praying to god and he hears.The god give his grace to the person.The mix of lines showing a halo vs the ragged clothes is beneficent.I feel in awe as jesus is blessing the women it warms my heart.The sunburst around the man's head makes me think that this scene is from the bible.

albrecht-durer_the-dresden-altarpiece-central-panel-1496,sadness,"The muted colors make this art feel very solemn. the subject matter is also sad feeling. it appears as though she is praying over a sick baby.The baby has the head of a man and its mother is already praying for the baby's health.The somber colors (maybe an underpainting?) and worried look on the woman's face make me feel that something is wrong. is the baby dead? the angels are bringing a crown, but they look sinister to me.i don't trust them."

albrecht-durer_the-virgin-and-child-with-st-anne,amusement,"The expression on the people's faces makes me amused.The woman on the left is wearing a garment around her head and chin and it accents her bright white eyes.The woman wearing the white has some really funny, buggy looking eyeballs and i cannot help but laugh when i look at her.The white head garment on the woman makes her look like she has a huge head and a tiny face."
albrecht-durer_title-page-to-the-second-latin-edition-of-1511-1498,awe,"A holy aura surrounds the mother and child.Most religious paintings with jesus and his mother are always awe-inspiring, especially medieval paintings.The woman and her baby are radiating light, suggesting they are protected by god.The mother and her child are holy, since they are beaming with divine light."

dirk-bouts_the-middle-panel-of-the-pearl-of-brabant-adoration-of-the-magi,something else,"Its a old oil made around the 1500s. a very repetitive style during those times and important to notice to depict christianity.Thread is striking and draws the eye end but the focus of the image is the little baby.I am confused as to what is taking place in this picture, it seems like some sort of religious ceremony. although the artwork is nice and rich, i wouldn't buy it due to the fact that i am not sure which religion it's based on."
gerard-david_virgin-and-child-with-four-angels,awe,"Two angels are placing a crown on a woman's head, which makes the scene seem regal.The red garments help highlight the virgin mary as a figure of central importance.The concept of gurdian angels coming alive in the picture where mother is taking care of her newborn aware of the surroundings."
hans-baldung_harmony-or-the-three-graces-1543,amusement,I love how the girl in the middle is posed. she kind of reminds me of the naughty popular girls in school who think they're hot stuff but they're really not.I see this picture and wonder what happened to unclothe so many people all in the same area. there has to be a story.The individuals seem quite intrigued by the situation that is unfolding around them. the number of naked people is quite funny.
hans-baldung_hercules-and-antaeus-1531,disgust,The man appears like he is bent on harming the man quite terribly.The way the man in the mask is holding the other man looks like a scene in a horror movie. it's very disturbing.The appearance of what is transpiring appears violent and almost rape-like.
hans-holbein-the-younger_outgoing-ship,excitement,"The men look like they are working very hard on some choppy water, it doesn't look very dangerous since there is a dingy in the water.The boat seems quite at capacity and the sailors all seem to be clamoring for adventure.The boat is packed with people who are sailing away on an adventure."
hans-holbein-the-younger_portrait-of-robert-cheseman-1533,awe,"I am amazed at the detail and realism of this painting, the face is in great proportions and angles and the bird looks so lifelike.The picture is very detailed and crisp. i think the falcon is symbolic of that the man has a dark motive abouts him.The hawk looks regal and majestic since it's so big.The bird that this man is holding is very majestic looking, yet scary at the same time. i can't believe people used to have this type of bird as a pet!"
hans-memling_triptych-of-jan-floreins-1479,awe,"The artist is very good at recreating an image of bored people it looks very real.The dimensional frames look as if this picture could be closed up.Beautiful colors and content, makes me just want to stare at it to find all the details."
hieronymus-bosch_temptation-of-st-anthony-1,amusement,"There are flying fish and human deer. someone is crawling underneath the hill and looking at it all. there is a spire on top of the fish vehichle.Boats and fish are flying through the air, which is totally nonsensical.It's a whimsical painting. i'm unsure of what to think other than amusement- boats and fish in the sky."
hieronymus-bosch_the-garden-of-earthly-delights-1516-8,amusement,I feel the red apples signify a challenge or game.That is a lot of bros that like to ride the white pony.It's funny that all of the people are riding the animals without any clothes on.
hieronymus-bosch_the-garden-of-earthly-delights-4,awe,"Makes me think of futuristic sci-fi, which makes me wonder what the distant future will be like.It's hard to decipher what is depicted in this painting, however, it is a very stunning piece.The painting looks like a town is placed inside a globe.The world as depicted through a glass globe or a paperweight seems rather spectacular.This scene looks mystical since there are clouds of white hanging beneath the glass."
hugo-van-der-goes_portinari-triptych-detail-1478-4,something else,"This portrait of a man's face which captures details of the man's bowl-cut hair and red collar is not enough to capture the interest of the viewer.It doesn't really evoke anything from me, it just seems too much like a head floating in the middle of space.I'm not getting much in the way of emotion on this one. he seems pretty stoic."
hugo-van-der-goes_the-portinari-altarpiece-st-thomas-and-st-anthony-the-hermit-with-tommaso-portinari-and-two-1478,awe,The man with the red and green dress looks imposing with his staff.A golden holy ring surrounds the man's head.The great colors and darkness seems to haunt my soul.The man stands tall and confidently with his green robe.
jan-van-eyck_the-annunciation,awe,I am in awe looking at this important moment in the birth of jesus.The contrast of the simple facial expressions with the detailed clothing make it an elegant picture and awesome to study.The size of the interior makes me feel this way.The angel is wearing an incredibly elaborate robe.
jan-van-eyck_the-annunciation-1440,awe,"The angel looks rather holy with his wings and large stature.The detail of the sculpture, the folds of the robe, the wing feathers, the hair, is incredible.The wings on the statue give a sense that the statue is an angel who is standing there watching out to protect all.Angels remind me of my father in heaven."
jan-van-eyck_the-ghent-altarpiece-1432,awe,Looks like a ceremony is about to take place and royals are watching.The colors beautifully fit together and the panels perfectly depict daily life of the era.This is a very structured painting meant to inspire awe in christians.
jan-van-hemessen_the-lamentation-of-christ,sadness,"The sad nature of the peoples emotions reminds me of death.The vulnerability of the semi-naked man appears as if he is in pain or possibly dead due to the pain shown on the people's faces sitting around him.The pain of a mother,a friend and others when they are helpless and have to see their beloved in pain.This is one of the saddest single moments in religious mythology."
jean-fouquet_battle-of-jericho,excitement,"The houses in the background are muted, but the people in the foreground are brightly covered and seem to be celebrating something with musical instruments.The worshippers appear to be transferring a symbol of enormous importance, like the holy of holies, on a hillside.The bright colors and the instruments give a sense of fanfare."
jean-fouquet_coronation-of-lothair-1460,awe,The brilliant blue color behind the fleur-de-lis symbols is royal and stately.The depicted scene looks quite detailed and elaborate.The woman kneeling to the bishop makes for an awe-inspiring sight.
jean-fouquet_coronation-of-louis-the-pious-1460,awe,"The person on their knees is praying which has great religious significance.This scene looks royal and important, since only the king's highest-ranking men are gathered.These people know that prayer is the best form of protection they have.I love the contrast in this painting. there is two different sides which makes it really unique."
jean-fouquet_the-crucifixion-1460,sadness,"Jesus and his two compatriots are all dying on crosses.The roman soldiers dispassionately observe the horrific suffering of jesus and others by crucifixion.The prisoners are being mistreated by the wealthy. the rich have gowns with beautiful colouring to depict class.Crucifixion art where royals seem to mistreat the poor or criminals. the colouring is bright and encouraging but the art shows a tragic sadness.I am greatly saddened by the story told in this painting which is also an extremely beautiful piece of art.Jesus and two others are on the cross suffering while people watch and do nothing.I feel sad for the men being murdered on the crosses in this image.This is very sad - the three men are being crucified to death and it looks like the men at the bottom are fighting about it. the woman in blue at the lower left is very sad, almost despondent. the tones of blue are calming but this is not a calm scene.It is a sad scene for the crucifixion of christ here. even for non-believers, it feels sad.I'm not sure what  this thing is people have with seeing a religious icon suffer.  it just seems odd to me.  i don't like seeing people in pain.I feel sadness because there are three people being crucified in the painting. the use of blue also creates a feeling of sorrow as well as the people who are visibly upset in the painting itself below the three crosses.That which is just is not always right.These men look like they are being tortured and it makes me upset.As a non religous person i dont really care about this but the act of crusifixtion is pretty sad.Jesus is dying at the center cross, and other men are being hung beside him.People being tortured on a cross while others look on is sad.Three people crucified on the cross as  people are cheering on  its depressing.Even though the colors are brilliant and upbeat and the crucified seem resigned, the subject matter is nonetheless sad and remorseful.This crucific scene makes me sad and happy about the outcome.It's sad how these people are watching others getting put to death.The subject matter of the painting, christ on the cross, makes me feel sad because most people don't understand what it means.The poor people mourn the men stuck on the crosses.This painting shows jesus and other religious on the cross surrounded by people. it gives out a feeling of sadness.This is a detailed picture of the crucifixion.This picture represents the crucifixition of our lord and savior jesus christ. remembering this event is sombering.The raised crosses emphasizes the crucified men's humiliation.This is a powerful scene with jesus christ in the middle and a sinner on either side with soldiers and citizens mocking them and shaking spears at them in judgment. i'm sad that jesus was being punished, though he was completely innocent.This picture makes me feel a multitude of things hope and fear, and a lot of sadness, its a lot rolled into one.Even if it is religious it is sad to see people tortured to death.Crucifixion was a horrible way to kill someone. i believe this is the crucifixion of jesus and that story always makes me sad."
lucas-cranach-the-elder_portrait-of-geiler-von-kaiserberg,fear,Something about his face and black cloak seems dastardly.The dark colors and the man's facial features give this work a fearsome feel.I am threatened by the sinister look on the man's face.

rogier-van-der-weyden_triptych-of-st-eloi,sadness,"No one can do anything to save jesus from his impending death.The art for the masses to remind of constant suffering, death and doom.The bleak colors and the scene leave one filled with sadness and something lacking.There is a biblical feel to the image, it is bleak and filled with sadness."
georges-lemmen_the-two-sisters-1894,sadness,This photo makes me feel sad because both of the girls faces are sad and look upset.I feel sad for these girls made to dress so rediculously for this moment.Both of the girls in the picture look sad.

allan-d'arcangelo_constellation-1971-1,amusement,This creates an interesting illusion and changes with the angle you look at it.The different elements in this painting fit together in a strange and funny way.I like the way it makes you think like its a puzzle and you need to figure it out.
allan-d'arcangelo_mr-and-mrs-moby-dick,something else,This image makes me feel confused because i have no idea what it is.It looks industrial and really leaves me feeling just neutral. the whole doesn't move me at all. they could be two shipping containers that somebody will make into a tiny home.It makes me feel like i'm being watched because the objects resemble security cameras.
allan-d'arcangelo_untitled-1966,something else,"Makes me feel bewildered, my imagination can't figure this one out.A sense of unreality because the mix between the windows in black and the background a bit diffuse.The modern artwork of the tan colored monitor stands out and looks 3d with the black background."
andy-warhol_dollar-sign,excitement,"I see a lot of power in it.Obviously its like having money at home.The colorful edgy pop feel along with the bold font scream excitement.The blue background color is very bright, the dollar sign also makes me think of money."

andy-warhol_marella-agnelli-1973,amusement,This woman's eyeshadow is outrageous! such a unique choice! looks kind of clownish though...Looks like a late 1960s housewife got into some drugs that psas of that time said were bad and decided to experiment with makeup.Colorful and simply dandy!
andy-warhol_self-portrait-1,something else,Feels intriguing. trying to decide exactly what is going on in the piece.Confused- this is a bright red blood color-  am i looking at 1 person? 2 people?  a man?  it is just too bright red for my taste and hurts my eyes.I'm not even sure what to say. but that is an awful lot of red.

derek-boshier_plan-1-1972,something else,"It seems like this image was rejected from an old school vide game. the use of perspective is cool, but the overall effect is confusion.Confusing as i got lost looking at it.I feel confusion when i look at this painting because i'm not sure what the symbols mean when compared to the city in the background."
eduardo-paolozzi_meet-the-people-1948,amusement,"Lucille ball was hysterically funny and made me laugh. paired with minnie it is weird and funny at the same time.This is a nice, kitschy blend of pop culture.I like the old vintage characters and objects, very nostalgic.Lucille ball makes me smile as does minnie mouse. this is an odd mishmash of objects with them. love the bright colors."
gerard-fromanger_le-linceul-n-a-pas-de-poches-2002,something else,It's a clever way of making the figure stand out but you can't tell whether that's a good or bad thing.The circled man looks dangerous.I am confused at the man with the sunglasses and what he is waiting for or looking at.
gianfranco-baruchello_bagno-a-1977,something else,"This made me frustrated because i have no idea what is suppose to be or mean.Intrigued - thre is a story there, possibly architecture based, but it is appealing to figure it out.The sculpture makes me confused because i'm not sure what i am supposed to be looking at."

howard-finster_leonardo-da-vinci-1991,amusement,"The notes at the bottom of the image make me curious about this piece.It's amusing because it looks somewhat clownish with the bright colors,and childish shapes.The childlike quality of the drawing in this painting is accessible and striking."

saul-steinberg_untitled-1971,something else,"This painting is confusing with its boldness and color words.Nostalgic, it's been done in a very vintage style.This doesn't do much for me, but it does contain one of my pet peeves. why is green always included with primary colors? why is it never another color? i like the font type, but i don't really understand the cardboard textures, the stamps, or what the artist is trying to say about these colors. why is yellow the only one written in two colors? (wouldn't that make more sense for green?) why is red the base? why are red and blue the most prominent? i just don't understand this one."

vincent-van-gogh_churchyard-in-the-rain-1883(1),sadness,"This cemetery looks very sad in the rain. some of the crosses look like it is sliding into the water.The men are digging a hole into the ground for a grave.Dreary colors, dark figures (mourners?) the size of the grave and number of crosses may mean a mass burial is about to occur.The black and beige colors are depressing and there are crosses in the center with men digging deep ditches. it reminds me of the holocaust.Some people are digging holes for the graves.I'm pretty sure the two men are digging graves, since there is a cross marker placed near them. such a depressing, gloomy looking scene.The painting is just kind of dark. it looks like they're digging a grave or something based on the cross.Well the picture seems to be people like in a grave yard about to be burying a person. also picture is so colorless its just so dull.There is only sadness for what looks like digging graves in the rain.Very bleak, grave diggers against a monochrome background.I feel a tragic sadness looking at this because the people are digging a grave.Everybody is digging up holes for the dead people.The digging of a mass grave with the grim reaper watching.Buckets of rain are falling from the dimly lit sky.It looks like these gentlemen are digging some sort of grave, which is really sad.The subdued neutral tones add to the sadness of this graveyard scence. one man in the foreground is digging with a shovel. a cross and small casket shaped box are visible.It looks like they are digging a grave for someone.Everybody is looking over at the tombstones.The yellow color and the downward brushstrokes all give this image the feeling that the end is near. we're left to wonder if that shadowy figure is the grim reaper admiring his latest work.The sepia tone give a dark uncomfortable feeling.I feel sad looking at this depiction of a burial.  the cross is a nice touch.I grieve for these men digging a grave in the rain as showdowed figgers stoop past behind them.It looks like heavy sheets of rain are falling on the workers outside.Looks like another miserable day for the yard workers.The figures look to be digging graves in a lonely graveyard.Gosh, it looks like they're digging graves. how depressing. however, the color of the painting also gives off a dreary effect, such that if it were done in color with green grass and blue skies i might actually enjoy the work.I feel a tragic, depressed, sadness when i look at this because the people digging seem to be digging a grave. it makes me feel like they're losing something and someone important.A morbid drawing, pencil sketching of a mass grave being dug by only two fellow with others people walking about.The darkness of the picture reflects well with the fact the men are digging graves.The men dig graves, as if people have suddnely died.Heavy sheets of rain are falling on these people working in the field.The scene is sad because someone has died, the colors are drab and it has a lonely figure waiting for them to finish."

william-turner_welsh-bridge-at-shrewsbury,awe,"Looks like a village that i may see in a foreign country duch as italy. beautiful architecture, with buildings that go over a bridge and the hollow part of the brige to let small boats of traffic through.The structure is quite beautiful in the way it stands over the river.The shadows and light on the architecture is detailed. i like the reflection of it in the water too.The buildings look very big and detailed. the sky has a number of big dramatic clouds."

arnold-bã¶cklin_meerestille-calm-sea-1887,disgust,"This picture looks random and the colors and scene are gross.Bird poop, blood, pain, nakedness, what is not disgusting?Nakedness, blood, being pooped on by birds.  all kinds of yuk."
arnold-bã¶cklin_self-portrait-with-death-as-a-fiddler-1872,fear,"It feels ominous because of the colors and the skeleton hanging on to the subject.I feel fear for the man in the painting with the skeleton leaning on his shoulder.Looks like death is on his shoulders, creepy.An animated skeleton menaces a still-living man with the same music that made the skeleton become undead.He has a frightened expression on his face."
arnold-bã¶cklin_the-ride-of-death-the-fall-and-death,fear,This is dark and looks like something could be lurking in the shadows.Extremely ominous looking.The dark trees and bushes give this painting a creepy feeling.

felicien-rops_st-therese-as-a-philosopher,sadness,"The person wrapped around the guy nailed to the cross is obviously upset. she's sad for her loss.I get the biblical reference here, but i fail to see how this is art.The woman is hugging against the guy who is tied on the cross.There is a suggestion of extreme mourning."

fernand-khnopff_baroness-fernand-van-der-bruggen-1900,sadness,"The woman’s body just seems to fade away into nothingness at the bottom of the painting.I feel sadness because of the bland and almost transparent look of the image, but also because the person in the image does not look happy and instead looks like he/she is just enduring something.The clouded color clouding the woman's face make me think that she is fading away."
frantisek-kupka_the-way-of-silence,awe,"Amid the tombs of the pharos.This is  really cool depiction of all the sphinxes - quite unique in my mind.This makes me feel in awe because the sky looks beautiful and the monuments majestic and i would be in complete awe if i were the person in the pictures taking in all of this.The statues and vast night sky make me think of a higher power watching over everything, including the lone walker."
franz-stuck_dissonance-1910,amusement,"The little boys music is defeating the evil man-wolf.I am amused because my kids also bug me playing musical instruments terribly.The baby devil is cute and it's funny that the big devil is disturbed by the music he is playing.Pan is being annoyed by his own instrument is rather funny.The satyr is making me laugh. like, ""shut the hell up, kid! go practice somewhere else!""."

jacek-malczewski_death-of-ellenai,disgust,"The man kissing the sleeping woman's foot is disturbing.Gross. the earliest expression of a foot fetish? to each their own, i suppose but not for me.The positioning of the perspective make the affections appear unwanted and unsolicited.Woman appears dead. she has dirty clothing and body, yet the man is sucking her toes."

koloman-moser_pieta,sadness,"Very realistic details in the hand covering the grieving face. the hair on the deceased man could have been more detailed, adding depth and emotion to this piece. the neck and collarbone areas look very strange, but it portrayed exceptionally if you believe this is jesus, who was crucified. the details would be congruent with someone who died on a cross.  the mishapen appearance of the muscles holding the arms in that position for so long, until death.Looks like a man crying over a dead guy on the table. this makes me feel so sad. why would someone want this painting.The man lying down is probably dead, being mourned by someone who loved him.The woman's hand on her face really evokes sadness and grief over the situation."

nicholas-roerich_path-to-kailas-1931-1,awe,"Wow, this looks like a scene taken from a farm in new zealand. amazing view.You dont need modern amenities when you have a view like that.Because the bright colors are so realistic and they show you what it is like to view the top of the moutains from the top of the mountains.I think it would love living on these hillsides and waking up to this view everyday."

nicholas-roerich_the-tsar-bell-1919,something else,"I feel curiousity.  the details in these drawings are not enough for me to know what they are exactly.  i'm thinking they are drawings of old radios from the 50's, maybe.Confusion because i am not sure what these two sketches are therefore i cannot tell how i feel about them other than confused.The thin outlines of the figures make the painting confusing."

odilon-redon_angel-executions,disgust,"The human head on a platter and the weird no leg body is disturbing.Clearly putting another mans head on a plate is disgusting, unless there is a backstory i need to know.The robotic-like man degrades another man's severed head by displaying it on a food platter."

odilon-redon_silence-1900,sadness,"The woman's averted eyes and fingers over her mouth suggest she is keeping a shameful secret. she seems trapped and alone, which makes me feel sad.A woman mourns looking out a small window, thoughtful.I think that the woman's eyes look a little bit sad."
odilon-redon_the-dream,awe,"There is something about the way the colors are emphasized that makes me think these men are transcending my own experience.With so many things to look at, this reminds me of fancy origami paper.The figures are surrounded by very different brushstroke auras which adds dimension.The colors in this painting are so vibrant. i love how it feels so cerebral."
odilon-redon_the-eye-like-a-strange-balloon-goes-to-infinity-1882,amusement,I like the eye balloon holding up what looks like a ufo. it makes me think that the painter really believes in ufos and we just need to open our eyes to see it.An eye inside a helium balloon makes me laugh at the cleverness.Black and white picture looks whimsical a round balloon floating with an eye on it and a funny shaped item makes me wonder whats is going on.
odilon-redon_underwater-vision-1910,disgust,This picture reminds me of trash floating in the water.This remnds me of mold and algae on top of food.The shapes and red circles against the blueish background make me think of microbes under a microscope.
pablo-picasso_hurdy-gurdy-1905,something else,"The shade of paint in the man face, and how him and the boy sets is creepy.I'm not sure if the boy sitting on the ground is a puppet or a real boy. i cannot make out what the box-like thing is on the mans lap.A little creepy with the colors and figures."
pablo-picasso_the-tragedy-1903,sadness,I feel sad for the gamily depicted as they look cold and dirty. it looks like they have had a hard life.The dark blue colors that is portrayed from the people in this photo shows sadness and deep emotions.The blue give the painting a sad tone and the figures in the painting look cold.The blue in the painting and the figures look sad.
theodor-severin-kittelsen_sorgen,sadness,"The lone figure walking in the snow makes for a sad sight.The person is all alone in a vast, empty winter wasteland.The muted black and white color with the lone figure cloaked in black evokes a sense of despair and loneliness."
victor-hugo_p-cherie-at-night,fear,The dark shadows are eerie and the image is undefinable so it makes me wonder what might be lurking in the darkness.The imagery is very dark and blurry so i can't tell exactly what is happening but it doesn't look good.Looks as if an abandoned watched tower is the only thing left to guard against the night.The dark and unclear strokes make this picture seem spokey.
victor-hugo_planet-1866,fear,There appears to be a frightening eye-like monster in the shadows.It seems that the ball is being sucked into the darkness.The dark cloud and mysterious round shape that cannot quite be made out make me feel very apprehensive.
william-blake_illustration-to-milton-s-comus-1820-3,awe,"It is as if jesus is talking to god who holds the kingdom.The humble man did not think himself worthy to be carried away to heaven.The figure on the left appears to be divinely inspired, and is pointing upward as a result.Jesus and moses are in an important conversation about heaven."
william-blake_milton-s-mysterious-dream-1820,awe,The rainbow against the yellow is holy swirls.The symbol of what happens to the body after buried.The vibrant imagery and colors along with the classical iconography gives it a magical aesthetic.

ito-jakuchu_tiger,fear,The cat looks as if it's up to no good.The gray predatory feline with bulging eye ridges is a disturbing image particularly as this big cat appears to be smiling at its prey.One creepy cat.
katsushika-hokusai_kuwana-4,sadness,One of the men seems sad.There is a very strong use of elements that arouse a sense of loneliness among the subjects.This picture makes me feel sad because it looks scary. it would appear that everyone is sad because they are mourning someone.The man sitting appears to be crying because of something the standing man is doing.
katsushika-hokusai_manga,disgust,Ugly faces.The images of masks feature grotesque looking faces.The faces are deformed looking.
katsushika-hokusai_manga-8,amusement,"Wonderfully drawn but almost cartoon like,  the top right image is particuarly amusing.The positions of the guys is hilarious and makes me laugh.The men seem to be having fun. kind of a weird painting.Its mildly grotesque but humorous."

katsushika-hokusai_snake-curling-around-a-bamboo-stalk-with-a-sparrow-on-it,fear,"The snake is scary and the bird's urgent flight seems scary too. perhaps he is flying from the snake.Snakes are not pleasant, and neither is the reality of the bird becoming prey to the snake.The snake makes me feel scared.Fear is showing for the bird on the pole because of the snake. then relief for the bird flying into the rainbow away from the snake."
katsushika-hokusai_street-scenes-newly-pubished-7,fear,"Scary figure at the central part of the painting.The face of the focal point looks scary & the people look depressed.It looks like a demon king of some kind ruling over a bunch of people, which is a bit disturbing.He has face of demon.The man looks angry - his face is showing his teeth and his expression looks like he wants to hurt me."
katsushika-hokusai_surumaru-daiyu,awe,The colors used in this painting are  not very tradition and very cool to look at and see the scenery.The symmetry of the landscape and people walking.The blue hills are beautiful and i like the characters too.I like how the blue looks like it could be snow.
katsushika-hokusai_the-back-of-the-fuji-from-the-minobu-river,awe,"Because of the scale of the piece of work and the complimentary colors. i like the differences between the mountains, and then the path in the foreground. i also really like the deep blues and greens with the pale pinks, whites, and yellows.The lines and colors create a depth that is almost 3d.Dramatic movemnts and calm state of the people.Great colors. beautiful mountains. could use some more detail, though."
katsushika-hokusai_yurei,amusement,"The creature in the image makes me think of a character out of a children's story book, like where the wild things are.This looks like a hedgehog combined with a woman. really weird, yet cool.This looks like a lady jumping through the air. she is having a good time so it makes me feel good!I love this painting; everything about the main figure, from her facial expression to her posture, seems so joyful."
kitagawa-utamaro_shower-1,sadness,"This piece reminds me of a struggling family left in the rain trying to get by on a journey.The dark, mellow colors and the setting of the rainstorm make me sad.This photo is sad because the woman on the ground look to be in pain or suffering and the woman standing look to be in grief also."
kitagawa-utamaro_streetwalker,amusement,"Why is she eating the fabric?The culture is interesting, but how the woman has a head scarf in her mouth is funny/interesting.Why is this woman eating her headpiece? this is funny, to me."
kitagawa-utamaro_yamanba-and-kintaro-sakazuki,amusement,"I had this one already and like i said it is strange but the more you look at it the more i like it!  it is amusing.I'm wondering if the woman's hair is like that always or because she's busy with an infant.It looks like nikki sixx from motley crue feeding a pie to a monchichi doll.This photo is amusing to me, but it is funny. this baby is a fat little baby and it looks like she is eating a pie."
ogata-gekko_dragon-rising-to-the-heavens-1897,fear,"The serpent in the picture along with the black smoke coming up from it invokes fear, reminds me of fire.A strange combination of a serpent and a bird.This is a monster just waiting to be released to reek havoc on the world."
ogata-gekko_picture-of-severe-battle-on-the-streets-of-gyuso-1895,excitement,"The action in the scene makes me feel excited for a great battle.I feel excitement when i see the people fighting on the ship at war.Soldiers are charging, but i'm not sure who they are.  they don't look japanese, despite the flag and the writing."
tsukioka-yoshitoshi_farting-at-a-kappa-at-the-lumber-yard-in-fukagawa,disgust,"The creature in the water looks like it's about to stick an object in the person with blue hairs butt.Subject matter is deplorable to me, what some people call 'mooning', very disrespectful. who would want to paint it, although i do like the expression of the person sitting on the step, eyes covered, that's comical.The sharp sword is going to pierce through the person's anus."
tsukioka-yoshitoshi_looking-as-if-she-wants-to-change-the-appearance-of-a-proprietress-of-the-kaei-era,excitement,"Know i will enjoy watching my plants growing once i get them home.The woman with the plants looks so happy, and it makes you  want to follow the story and see the plants as they grow.That lady looks so happy about those little plants."
utagawa-kunisada_not_detected_239640,awe,"Such incredible detail on the kimono and the woman's expression make me love this.A lovely oriental woman observing her fine artistry and looking for improvements.The way the person is dressed leaves me in awe, despite not knowing what she is up to in the painting."
utagawa-kunisada_not_detected_240349,amusement,"I really like japanese erotic art, and this is a good example. it looks kind of like fun.I guess this could be considered ""proto-anime?"" got to wonder what the captioning says...The painting looks sexual but it is hard to it with their body and head positions."
utagawa-kunisada_surimono,amusement,"The awkward pose looks like it would be uncomfortable.I love the masturbation on her hairy bush, so provocative coming from a geisha who is supposed to be so formal.It took me a minute to figure out what i was looking at. its a different subject that i wasn't expecting to see but the red is really eye catching."
utagawa-kuniyoshi_a-shapeshifting-cat,fear,The man in the middle with animal ears is creepy!The eyes of the animal in the middle is very scary.The cat in the middle really creeps me out for some reason.
utagawa-kuniyoshi_eight-hundred-heroes-of-our-country-1,fear,"A fight to the death in the custom of samurai warriors.Very fearful, this guy's about to lose his head.This japanese swordsman looks like he being ambushed. his unsheathed sword depicts his unpreparedness."
utagawa-kuniyoshi_keyamura-rokusuke-under-the-hikosan-gongen-waterfall,anger,The imagery reminds me of a storm and destruction and makes me feel a sense of anger.This man looks like hes seething in anger and it seems like alot of chaos is going on.Unhappy bath time. reminds me of being a kid.
utagawa-kuniyoshi_lacquered-boxes-against-rain,anger,"The scene depicts war and the characters painted look unhappy.The warriors lined up with guns leveled is violent and distressing. japan was our enemy in world war ii, and i dislike this picture and its message of aggression.The linear formation of the soldiers reminds me of a firing squad."
utagawa-kuniyoshi_musashi-on-the-back-of-a-whale,awe,The details are beautiful - the spots on the whale look like stars - and it's very dramatic.Gorgeous painting. samarai is very intense. feels like he's fighting a whale in a storm.The details on the water and on the whale are amazing but the most cool part is that the whale actually looks human somehow and like it's mixing with a human in a spiritual world.The black and white bubble outline of the humpback whale is really a neat design that helps it stand out against the waves.
utagawa-kuniyoshi_oniwakamaru-about-to-kill-the-giant-carp,excitement,"Finally, the brave one has caught the sea serpent and will not let him get away.There is a lot of movement and action in this piece with the man hunting the giant koi.I wonder if the man with the knife will be able to save the man in the monsters mouth."
utagawa-kuniyoshi_rape-scene,anger,This woman is being raped and abused and that makes me pretty angry.These jerks look like they're abusing this woman.Looks like the brutes are raping or doing an  unwanted procedure on this woman.
utagawa-kuniyoshi_shimamura-danjo-takanori-riding-the-waves-on-the-backs-of-large-crabs,anger,The guy looks very mean.The scowling face and turbulent sea invoke anger.The person looks angry and is holding a long sword as if preparing to fight someone.
utagawa-kuniyoshi_sotoku-invoking-a-thunder-storm,fear,"Creepy type of spiritual feeling when looking at this painting. kind of looks like a chinese banshee.The creepy figure on the middle of the picture looks like an evil ghost, also the dark ocean and grey background makes the view creepy.The dark colours and chaotic scene inspires my fear.The man looks crazed and the lightning and turbulent waters are frightening.The character with the blue face looks like a demon or ghost."
utagawa-kuniyoshi_the-actor-10,amusement,"The man on the right doing something with his right foot that is peculiar - kicking the other man?The foot on his back, and his slightly amused look on his face is amusing.The two men remind me of children in a tussel."
utagawa-kuniyoshi_the-actor-6,excitement,The japanese painting and symbols makes me want to visit japan.The oriental woman that is offset by a miniature man hanging from a pole brings laughter to me.The two men are staring at each other as if they are getting ready to do battle.
utagawa-kuniyoshi_the-actor-7,amusement,The expression on the face makes him look cross-eyed.The man's cartoonish expression makes an unfunny painting very funny.The expression on the warrior and clothing make him look like an iguana.
utagawa-kuniyoshi_the-actor-ichumura-meeting-a-cat-ghost,fear,"The cat looks angry and like it is about to pounce.It looks abrasive, it makes me feel like the tiger is going to attack.The enlarged dark eyes of the car are definitely scary.The samurai looks like he is being haunted by the spirit of his foe, that has taken shape of an angry cat."
utagawa-kuniyoshi_turtle-and-crab,amusement,It looks like that turtle is going really fast and will catch the bug.Looks to be an intense battle between a turtle and some kind of insect.The ant looks scared because of the turtle attacking it.
utagawa-kuniyoshi_women-22,amusement,Such a dignified woman in traditional japanese costume frolicking in the snow and having fun with her dog.The snowballs flying make this seem like a moment of play has been captured.The man seems to be in a snow ball fight and he looks amused making me feel the same.
utagawa-toyokuni_actor-in-role,amusement,"Funny haircut, ill fitting clothing and a shy demeanor, yet ready for battle.The guy looks like he's struggling with something.The warrior looks like he is carrying too many items. awkward!"
utagawa-toyokuni_kabuki-actors-sanogawa-ichimatsu-ii-as-hayano-kampei-and-osagawa-tsuneyo-as-onoe,amusement,"The look on her tells a story of that she has gotten over on this guy some how, i want to know that story.The man has a funny expression on his face.The characters, their clothing and facial expressions are quite amusing to me.The cool oriental man and woman appear to be engaging in a heated debate over an unopened gift box."
