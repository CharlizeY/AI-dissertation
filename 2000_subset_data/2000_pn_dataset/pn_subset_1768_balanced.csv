forrest-bess_spots-1967,positive,Somewhat amused as it seems like a little child's painting with bright colors but the dark lines spoil the painting.I like that hole up top. then there red and blue dots. i'm just amused by the lack of structure and clear subject of this work.The blue and red balls are fun and remind me of a clown or circus.
frank-bowling_37528-2008,negative,"It looks like the artist drew a rainbow, and then scratched it out in anger with a brillo pad.The red in the painting looks like blood drops for some reason.Yellow sickness slowly encroaches on the other print."
hans-hofmann_the-bouquet-1959,negative,"The colors blend together to make a nasty brown color which makes me think of diarrhea.The mixing of the colors make a gross looking brown color.The mix of colors, and erratic way it is mixed together, makes me go yuck!The colors together are ugly. i hate this type of art. i don't see anything at all that makes any sense whatsoever, and i wouldn't want to stare at it too long because i find it ugly."

jack-tworkov_thursday-1960,negative,"The lines resemble a prison cell made out of blood.This makes me feel a little aggressive. the red strokes signify blood or hate, and the black signifies death. the way they are combined is very primitive, as if full of toxicity.The red cuts through the black like scratches or scars in what feels like a fit of rage."
jack-tworkov_untitled-1955,negative,"This looks like something i would paint, rage in sharp brush strokes on a calming cream canvas.The strokes seem hurried and brash which creates an energy that feels negative.Anger management as a painting or an attempt to write in chinese.  visually, it makes me confused and upset.The scattered shapes and lines make are erratic and make me feel odd."

joan-mitchell_untitled-1973,positive,"The combination of colors and playfulness of the image.I like the contrast of the warm yellow/orange/red colors with the cool blue. reminds me of the beach on a summer day.Though i am not a fan of watercolor, i do like how the artist achieves solidity in the subjects.  i can see the hair, scarves, skirts, and shoes without the annoying wishy-washy watercolor effect.  i like the way the background keeps the eyes moving, but wish the shoes could be grounded on something--they look like they are levitating.  if they are levitating, there should be action lines to denote this, but these are not visible."

salvador-dali_arabs,negative,"It just looks like curdled milk; so gross and nauseating looking.The jumbled, twisted shapes of the picture do not depict anything clearly, but somewhat evoke the idea of rotten food or filth thanks to their putrid colors and shapes.Interesting texture but it looks like squeezed toothpaste noodles covered in mustard vomit."

sam-francis_untitled-1990,positive,The mix of colors is exciting and some give a motion feeling. a smear here and there adds dimension.The free spirit of the splattering coupled with the rainbow colors are exciting.The splatter of red green and blue complement each other and the horizontal and diagonal lines suggest movement.
sam-francis_untitled-1990-1,positive,"The watercolors are bright and contrasting and give a sense of motion.I love all of the bright colors, but this picture looks like an organized mess.Reds, yellows, blacks and blues  dance across the canvas in this piece i can see shapes in the piece that almost look like colorful animals.The shapes look like pipes and people."

willem-de-kooning_the-wave,negative,"The painting looks like a group of random, uneven shapes with no meaning.A blue background with different spots and shapes in different colors, grey, mustard, black and red.The curved lines throughout the work contrast unpleasantly with the reddish orange square - the entire work is discordant and irksome, as if it were made by different artists who refused to communicate with each other."
willem-de-kooning_two-figures,positive,"The soft, clay tones of the painting give it a warm, calm aura.The mountains and nature depicted in this image make me feel very relaxed. i like how the colors are soft as well as they add peacefulness to the image.At first this painting looks like just a bunch of squiggles but the colors seem to be balanced and peaceful."
willem-de-kooning_untitled-woman,negative,"Everything about the naked women is disgusting in this.The distortion of the figure takes away the human qualities and makes the figure look like a bag of meat. the use of red intensifies my repulsion and adds to the graphic nature of the image.This reminds me of the man known as sloth in the film se7en, one of the most grotesque scenes in movie history ever."

william-congdon_piazza-san-marco-no-5-1958,negative,"For some reason, this painting makes me think of a cemetery, or somewhere being caged in. it is very minimalist, so i could be getting the wrong impression. but the grey colors and lines leave me feeling like i am left alone in a lonely graveyard.This painting's white color is freezing cold. the greys are alomost suffocating.This looks lonely and unsafe because it seems like an isolated yard during winter and it has a wierd object in it that has cover over it. so it is a little creepy."
franz-kline_mahoning-1956,negative,"The intensity of black colors reminds me of the ruins after a fire.The hard and thick black strokes against white makes the strokes look even rougher and more aggressive. gives me a feeling of anger.The brushstrokes appear harsh and haphazard, and the dark smeared black evokes hostility."

a.y.-jackson_wilderness-deese-bay,negative,"It appears that there was a bad fire here that did a great deal of image.The scenery looks dead and barren.This instills a feeling of death and destruction, sadness and loss.It looks as if damage from fire of lava has occurred destroying natural beauty."

jacob-jordaens_the-daughters-of-cecrops-finding-the-child-erichthonius-1617,negative,"The overly fat woman sitting in the chair makes me want to gag myself.The flabby body shapes of the nude women felt excessive to me. the old lady wearing a bonnet was disconcerting.The fat and ripples of the nudes are quite revolting, the old woman in the back is getting cheap thrills, yuck."
jacob-jordaens_the-holy-family-with-characters-and-animals-in-a-boat-1652,positive,"The woman with her baby seems to be blessed by the heavens with their light clothes and aura.It appears as though the entire community is rallying together to travel on a voyage, with cattle, cargo, and sundry goods - and in the middle of it all is a mary and christ-child figure.   it makes me think of a grueling voyage sustained by faith.The men look exhausted from the day on the sea."

jan-steen_card-players,positive,The women appears to be trying to give cards to the dog.That lady's hair style is very strange looking and her smile is silly.I like the way that the dog on the right has just given up and gone to sleep.
jan-steen_tavern-scene,positive,"The image seems like a snapshot of life during a simplier time.This is an interesting scene, the dog looks like he's waiting for somebody to drop something.Feels really homey. the colors feel nostagic.How wonderful it must have been for these people to get together and really enjoy the companionship of each other."

joseph-wright_the-alchemist-discovering-phosphorus-or-the-alchemist-in-search-of-the-philosophers-stone-1771,negative,"This gives me spooky movie vibes, or like a mad scientist.I feel the anxiety of these people clamoring to the light.Due to the dark background and only a little of the actual image being in light.Dark ares lit by a single light source a man looking like he fears something beyond the darkness.The man in the darkness feels like he is conjuring up a spell or making a potion.Something terrible has brought the man to his knees."
juan-de-valdes-leal_carrying-the-cross-1661,negative,"The color are dark and gloomy.  this is the cruxifixtion of christ.The dark and gloomy colors and background depict to me the profound sadness of crucifying jesus.This is jesus carrying the cross. i am sad for the pain he endured.The misery on jesus' face as he endures his torture plus the looming, scary man on the right hand side."

le-nain-brothers_nativity-with-the-torch,positive,"The woman's cradling the baby in her hands as their skin glow.The baby jesus is painted with remarkable skill and appears three dimensional, levitating from the canvas.Clarity of the image is wonderful and the dark read robe of the mother is gorgeous.The light from the torch perfectly illuminates the people's faces, which look very realistic and detailed, down to wrinkles and facial hair.Looks like the birth of an important boy that will change the world."
le-nain-brothers_smokers-in-an-interior-1643,positive,"This is an excellent painting that is highly detailed and captures a historical moment in time.Although these men look stoic, this painting makes me feel amused, as they probably just had a few drinks and rousing conversation. it's like i'm there.The lighting and atmosphere of the painting is very warming."

peter-paul-rubens_the-discovery-of-the-child-erichthonius,positive,I am amused because if i am not mistaken i see someone or something with 5 breasts and as for the rest of the subjects i wonder what manner of debauchery this is depicting.This gives me a nostaligic feel becuase it reminds me of an albun cover of a band that i like in the 90's.One woman is fully clothed. and she appears amused by the fact.
peter-paul-rubens_the-drunken-silenus,positive,"This piece comes off as a bit humorous as the large man in the middle sort of looks like santa claus, and the person to the left makes an hilarious expression as they play two flutes.The man playing instruments on the far left does not seem excited to be playing at this party.Looks like santa got drunk."

rembrandt_jacob-shown-the-bloodstained-coat-of-joseph-1657,negative,The entire piece looks faded and old. the figure on his knees looks repentent as if begging for mercy. is this an initiation or a ritual of becoming a clergy man?  the shading is weird and looks incongruent or misplaced.The empty and colorless setting feels cold and scary.The man keeling appears to be injured in some way and the others are trying to help him.

guido-molinari_untitled-1966,negative,The red and black stripes make it dark and angry.This honestly looks like something anyone good do so i don't understand how this or things like this are really considered art.The colors are so very strong and of varying weights as though it's hypnotizing.

mark-rothko_black-on-maroon-3,negative,"The colors are black and shadowy, and the reddish brown makes me think a thief has just entered into a house and some light is coming in from his entrance.The dark colors and reds provide a feeling of fear making me think of death.The dark color scheme makes this feel very ominous, like something is lurking in the dark.It is so dark, that it makes you feel like something could be hiding in it."
mark-rothko_violet-black-orange-yellow-on-white-and-red,positive,"The pink and yellow make me think of cotton candy, sunny days, festivals, faires, all things happy and summery, which gets me excited.The bright colors and contrast between the pink and yellow is exciting to look at.The bright colors feel like sunshine and make you happy.The bright colors in this combination give an uplifting feel."
maurice-esteve_trigourec-1972-1,positive,"Normally, i don't like abstract art, but this one is intriguing. the bright colors contracted with the white really drew me in. i started seeing that maybe there's a window or patio door and maybe a balcony.This apparently random collection of shapes and colors is somewhat pleasing to the eyes as a visual stimulant that is not overtaxing.The color choices mixed with the uneven shapes makes me feel light and airy.The beautiful bright colors make me feel very warm."

eric-fischl_krefeld-project-bathroom-scene-2,negative,I don't want to see these gross people bathing.  i think the woman on the right is also disgusted by herself.This one creeps me out big time. weird naked people don't do it for me.The scene displays a certain sort of underlying violence.

jamie-wyeth_submerged-1975,positive,I am impressed at the high level of detail.Beautiful shadows and eerie colors. i'm not sure what's going on here but it's got me intrigued.It's a basic scene but the color and shading is masterful.
jamie-wyeth_warm-halloween-1989(1),negative,"I think the painting is scary, because the jack-o-lanterns looks sinister.Carved pumpkin in the field, if that's not scary what is.Scary faces.The scared faces on the pumpkins as well as the one that is rotted brings on a sense of fear."

john-miller_interior-landscape-mauve,negative,"I feel sad on this, it feels like this person is lost, all alone.There is splendor to the minimal clandestine guilt found in the image.The figure by themselves makes me feel very lonely.  the way they are so slim makes it seem like they are fading away."

neil-welliver_islands-allagash,positive,"This picture makes me feel calm and serene. i love full moons and watching the reflection of the moon on the water gives me a feeling of peace.An evening on the lake, very relaxing.I feel content because the water and islands look peaceful under the moon lit sky.The color scheme and simple lifework reminds me of a christmas painting.I love any and every kind of painting or photo depicting the wonders of nature.  beautiful moonlit night by artist's conception.The islands look beautiful and calming during the moonlit evening.These tiny islands in the moonlight look so placid and inviting.Peace is the moonlight hovering over quiet waters after a long day. there is nothing better than when i get a restful night of sleep.I feel content looking at this because it's a peaceful place with a lot of creativity done and blended into the picture.There's a sense of contentment, just existing under the moon, out in the wild. beautiful place.Although the water is a little choppy, the rest of the scene looks like a very calm moonlit night.The calm evening with the full moon, clear starry night, calm waterand evergreen forests on the islands is peaceful.I like the cool feeling of the blue monochrome and the way the moonlight is reflected on the water.Looks like a quiet, serene, relaxing environment with a lot of nature to enjoy.The full moon is casting bright, white light on rhe water.This is such a peaceful looking scene, it makes me want to go swim across the water and see what is on that island!The moon is out and it looks like a nice breeze is rolling in.The moonlight is exaggerated in the reflection of the water and this gives the picture a bright clear feel.This is something i would dream of looking out my window and seeing if it were real.The moon is the immediate thing that makes me feel relaxed and i imagine myself laying on that isolated hill looking up at the stars.I love the heavy shade of blue becoming lighter as it nears the horizon. evergreens are my favorite trees, and the moonlight on the waves is very calming. the islands are deserted (yay), and are within sight of land, so i have the feeling of safety. the sky is way too crowded with stars to be realistic. this picture is a lovely getaway for those of us who just don't have our own island yet.The dark sky along with the moon feels peaceful and relaxing.A tranquil pencil drawing of ocean, lake or river with the moonlight and many starts lighting the night."
neil-welliver_nude-in-striped-robe,negative,Do not think this naked woman prtrait is tasteful.I was not expecting to see a naked woman so i am slightly disgusted by this.Nakedness is not art in my opinion.It looks like some prostitute posing for video shoot.Hate the colors looks like she is green.

albert-gleizes_arabesque-brush-or-cubist-composition-1952,positive,The eclectic painting feels light hearted and whimsical even though there is an element of chaos.Interesting mix of colors.An unassuming vessel seems to spill over with what might be remnants of love letter or sprays of flowers in a colorful array.
albert-gleizes_untitled-6,positive,The people at work in the forefront of nature and community reflect the desire to improve and progress that is at the heart of the human experience.Very talented way to use shapes to depict men.A few friends getting together for laughs and stories.
andre-masson_portrait-of-the-poet-kleist,negative,The blood and mouth as well as the dark colors makes it scary.It looks like a zombie and the way the face is twisted and mouth is open scares me. other than that its.....interesting.This person is either a demon or a victim of a murder. either way it's terrifying.The looks very demonic - like a zombie coming to eat you.
ernst-ludwig-kirchner_sad-female-head-1929,negative,It seems like the subject is covering their eye in pain.Their inner self is expressed.The use of blues and darker colors as well as the face its self since it has a frown.The figure looks like it is crying and wiping away tears.The frown and geometric shapes make me think it symbolizes a broken heart.
ernst-ludwig-kirchner_traber-team,positive,"It looks the the horse is being playful and having fun.I feel excitement because i imagine myself being the rider of these two horses and without the whip, it looks exciting and fun.This makes me feel the excitement of going to the sulky racetrack and betting on the horses. i love it.The horses are galloping while the rider is enjoying the ride with their nose in the air."
fernand-leger_discs-1919,positive,The colors are bright and engaging and the random use of shapes creates a kaleidoscope of detail.For some reason all the colors remind me of being in elementary school.The stacked look and multitude of colors.
fernand-leger_the-creation-of-the-world-bird-drawing-of-costume-1923,positive,"It looks more like a guitar than a bird, that's funny.This looks like a peacock whom has been dressed up in modern shapes and sizes.The bird like creature is beautifully adorned and i wonder what he represents.The fantastical critter and colors are interesting."
fernand-leger_the-moulin-rouge,positive,The women's faces are lost amongst the chorus line of legs and skirts.Can-can girls.The character's face seems to be silly.
franz-marc_animal-destinies-the-trees-show-their-rings-the-animals-their-veins,negative,"This is scary, to me. it looks like a mixture of knives and other sharp objects.Reminds me of a wild animal that is harassing a small town killing kids.The shapes and color dramatic as if an animal is being hunted and his final minutes full of commotion."
franz-marc_deer-in-the-forest-ii-1914,positive,"I like this - its a family of deer, and the color composition shows the hierarchy but also warmth.The bright colours in the painting are quite stimulating.It makes me feel excited because the deer look so alert and they're portrayed with unconventional colors, sharp angles, and fragmentation."
gosta-adrian-nilsson_explosioner-1,negative,The colors are angry and the boat is being blown up.The orange and red look like flames coming out of a boat. the boat looks like it is on fire.This looks like a ship in a angry storm.I feel fear and anxiety because of the fire i see burning up this small ship.
henri-laurens_untitled-from-dialogues,positive,"This looks like a man screaming because there is a naked woman.I'm not a fan of abstracts, but it looks like a man is ogling a female figure.  the man's head looks crude, but comical.The blue person appears to not have legs.Abstract of a man seeing a naked woman for the first time.The squiggles look like pubes rushing off the page."
jean-david_figure(3),positive,"A woman's body is rearranged showing she is the sum of certain parts, most notably her buttocks.The woman who is naked and abstractly drawn looks like she is pregnant and is just oddly shaped.This is a strange picture.  it’s extremely blocky and geometric, yet the artist had to depict genitalia too.The fingers on the right hand resemble crayons."
jean-david_jaffa,positive,"This art seems childish, but still a lovely representation of an island, with boats in the sea. it makes me smile.The flat and blocky treatment makes the seascape and buildings look like a cartoon.The blocks and colors make this city look like a fun place!I really love the shapes and colors."
joan-miro_not_detected_227962,positive,"This poster features a beach, and reminds the viewer of traveling europe.It's a stylish ad with interesting graphics. the idea of paris and barcelona and the allure of these cities makes for a exciting concept.So much is going on lots of brightness and different styles makes it active."

julio-gonzalez_homme-cactus-dansant-1939,positive,"It looks like a monster a little child would draw but it is very good and reminds me of myself at a young age.The painting looks like a lobster wearing a hat while dancing.A playful piece that is funny and silly to view.This looks like a very abstract drawing of a cowboy and a gorilla.It looks like a monkey with a banana arm, wearing a top hat."
lyonel-feininger_the-village-of-legefeld-i-dorf-legefeld-i-1916,positive,"This looks like a  castle on top of a hill with a small village underneath, the shadows are ominous.The soft pastels of grey's and the maze type design gives a sense of houses  in the background.It is like a cloud picture but its a city and in the center is either a captain or a boat depending on the angle, it looks so simple but would be very hard to pull all together.The image is captivating, the hard lines make want want to travel into the drawing."
m.-h.-maxy_nude-with-veil-1922,positive,"This reminds me of stained glass in a church, all the colors coming together to make a beautiful portrait.What great use of simple shapes to make an image of a woman.The picture, as a whole is appealing visually with a nice color selection and shapes orientation together as a collage. when you start to look deeper at the painting and see that the shapes outline a drawing of a woman, it shows the attention to detail to make the underlying photo show."
marc-chagall_david-1914,positive,"Great energy in this portrait, which actually captures the spirit of the music.It's just a wonderful image, full of life and makes you think of jazz!You can tell he is really playing that instrument with passion."

nzante-spee_david-and-goliath-1995,positive,"The beautiful color scheme creates a journey with a strong sense of adventure. the busy elements add more amazing detail and interest.I'm amazed at the artist's choice to use bright reds, blues, and purples in the piece.The dark and saturated blues contrast well with the dark reds, especially on this person's shirt."

otto-gustav-carlsund_composition-g-om-trique-1925,positive,"It looks like a pleasant piano which makes me feel at peace.I like the variations in color, especially with the horizontal likes from the blue and white to the black and yellow.  it provides a neat contrast.This reminds me of a pile of random junk that you might find in someone's closet, even though i can't tell what any one object might actually be."
otto-gustav-carlsund_sitting-cubist-woman-1927,negative,"The body is drawn in an unidealized manner with heavy breasts and rolls of fat, but the face is a blank oval.  it looks grotesque.Looks like a fat monster with breasts, and that neck is awful.The lack of discernible facial features makes this both frightening and revolting."
pablo-picasso_a-reclining-female-nude-1936,negative,"I see a bloated body, like my spouse who sees herself as ugly. as if someone with severe depression is looking at themself (after having children) and seeing the bloated distortions of their body.. the exploding gut, sagging breasts..fat arms..  its a self portrait of someone who sees themselves as disgusting..I green and yellow do not blend well together and the lines don't flow very well.The grotesque and unrealistic proportions of the persons body as well as the green color make me feel ill and disgusted."
pablo-picasso_bust-of-a-woman-1942,negative,"Abstract art can be viewed as how the artist really see the inside of a person the dark colors and distorted features  show thoughts that the person has some mental health issues.The woman's face is distorted, creating an unpleasing sensation, as if you're looking into a carnival mirror.The face looks pigish and the colors are ugly."
pablo-picasso_cock-and-knife-1947,negative,The chicken looks like it will be slaughtered shortly and i get a sense of pain and looming fear because of it.Looks like a scorpion is escaping from the persons body.I feel fear as this animal is hacked to pieces.
pablo-picasso_las-meninas-velazquez-1957,positive,Lots of bold and strong colors in a maze of designs that looks like a village painting.A comic painting of a dog and little boy who is lost in the wizard of oz.This is a fun piece to look at.  there are all sorts of things going on and the colors are really vivid.All of these bright colors look great together. the red and yellow especially.

theo-van-doesburg_composition-the-cow-7,negative,"This is a random sketch of a square, not a real painting.The simple sketch lines tells nothing and confuses me on what this is suppose to be.Looking at this makes me think of a swastika, which only gives me anger."
yiannis-moralis_not-detected-16,positive,"The characters deppicted by merging shapes is just so fun to look at.A simple sketch of two figures fornicating, using basic shapes.It looks like a man and a woman facing each other with the woman straddling the man and his hands under her butt... probably having sex.Pictures like this always amuse me, not that they are clearly engaged in sexual activity, but the shapes that are used amuse me, yet also makes me realize we are all different."

giovanni-bellini_dead-christ-in-the-sepulchre-2,negative,"It is jesus standing in his own coffin, and his face is so sad.The man has had his side pierced and he is saddened.This painting reminds me of isaiah that says jesus is a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief.The man looks to be lost and forlorn."
giovanni-bellini_greek-madonna-1460,negative,"They both look sad, maybe because they know what will happen in the future.The faces, especially the baby's face have sad expressions on them.Grief and loss of a loved one maybe,  the expressions on both the mother and child are so heartbreaking.The mother and child look so depressed in this, and it's palpable.The sadness in both of their eyes and the way they are looking in the ditance, deep in thought."

chaim-soutine_landscape-of-cagnes,negative,The branch in the front of the picture looks like a large hand!The colors are unsettling in the painting and the images in the road appear to be fleeing from something.The blackness that surrounds the sleepy town is scary.
chaim-soutine_mother-and-child,negative,"The woman holding the child seems to be missing an eye and has an overall eerie feeling.The creepiness of this artwork is further enhanced by the muddy browns and greys in the background.What happened to the poor girl, that she and the doll have traded places.The child is missing an eye and that doll is really creepy looking.For some reason this is a very disturbing image.  the person's face looks damaged and inhuman, while the doll in her lap looks alive.  this is like something from a horror movie, and the dark colors around the subject only intensify the creepy vibes."
charles-demuth_the-shine-1916,negative,The different class of people at the top and bottom makes it uncomfortable to look at.The pleasing upturned faces to the clients kind of makes me angry for the shoe shiners.The painting depicts a stark contract between the working class and aristocrats.

corneliu-baba_piet-1986,negative,"A crowd gathered around a dead body, so sad to see their lost.The imagery only shows the non-descriptive nature of those around the dead man. i am torn between horror  and dislike.As he lay dead on the ground in front of them, their grief struck looks of horror and mourning portray utmost sadness.Details on people's faces show the deep grief they feel."
david-alfaro-siqueiros_head-of-a-woman-1936,negative,"This man's face looks singed, since there's a strip of black running down his forehead, as though he was hurt in a fire.Sad painting of a sad man because of the dark color that look gloomy.The colors are darker and gloomy.  the person in the picture does not look that happy."
dimitris-mytaras_untitled-1990,negative,"There are some awkwardly shaped limbs and faces, and some mucky colors.Wow, just wow. vibrant colors, but this should not be referred to as 'art'.The distorted women in odd colors don't look right."

edvard-munch_self-portrait-in-hell-1903,negative,"The orange background makes me think of fire and the black is like smoke as if the man is in a fire or in hell.The red and black in the photo make the man look evil.The man's fearful face, along with the orange and black color scheme, make me believe he's burning.That black shadowy shape behind the man could be a demon, or dark wings coming from behind him. the warm orange colors of the painting make one feel like he's in the underworld."
edvard-munch_self-portrait-with-cod-s-head-1940,negative,"The painting looks awesome until you u see what the guy is eating, it looks real disgusting.The man seems as if he is being forced to eat the head of a weird animal.The object on the plate looks somewhat like a skull and the man looks very ready to dig in. not a very good looking meal."

ernst-ludwig-kirchner_portrait-of-a-sick-man,negative,"Grotesque looking man creature with snarly hands and a mean and angry expression.The contrast of black and white always accentuates the scariness of a painting or drawing.This dark character looks evil and like i'm being threatened.This painting makes me feel fear, the man looks large and scary. the lack of color enhances fear."

filipp-malyavin_three-women-1902,negative,"All the women's faces are at the top of the painting which makes me feel like i am very short, looking up to them. the woman on the right is frowning and depicted in red so she feels menacing. the woman in the middle is smiling, but her form is much more ambiguous which makes me not trust her. the woman on the left is set furthest back in the painting and is partially obscured, but her facial expression looks worried. i fear for my safety.Two of the three people look dead, and the woman on the left has a terrified look suggesting she is next.These women look like witches and one looks like she is holding a chainsaw.The women in this image look evil and like they're judging the viewer.The perspective makes it creepy the way everyone is standing over the viewer.The reds make the woman look like a zombie."

ilka-gedo_ganz-factory-1948-1,negative,A man puts in many lonely hours at ty he factory he works at.This suggests chaos and hard repetitive work done by an anonymous figure.It looks like this lady is working in a supermarket with a checkbook and stacks of cash to her right.The picture expresses an emotion of loneliness.
ion-pacea_peisaj-de-litoral-1973,negative,"It looks like a close u shot of the eye of a colourful south american tree from, but given the red and white colour scheme, likely one of the poisonous ones.This looks like a blue eye surrounded by red, bloody lids and canthus. the swirling grey at the bottom is disturbing and suggests the flaking skin of a corpse.Looks like an eye floating in blood which is gross."

jackson-pollock_bird-1941(1),negative,"The staring psychotic eye seems to be opening a portal to another dimension.The colors mix in strange ways almost like they are in motion, while it is ambiguous what the figure in the foreground is, its black lines appear to be grasping at me like claws. the use of blues and reds in the eye in the background make it feel menacing and judgmental.The giant single eyeball sticks out, and it is not pleasant.  the heads at the bottom are also not good.  i don't want to know what this painter is trying to portray.The floating eye and misshapen heads are very strange and mystical."

jose-gutierrez-solana_still-life-with-dead-turkey,negative,"The sharp scene of a dead turkey or chicken is repulsive to me as it reminds me of pucking chickens as a child and that i did not enjoy.The dead chicken on the table bothers me because of its positioning.Dark colors give it a negative vibe, painting looks very unorganized like dirty dishes and the knife is somewhat ominous."
jules-perahim_the-argument-1958,negative,Dark colors and images cause you to feel fear in this picture.The men in black seem to be threatening the smaller men by force.The figures are dark and faceless and the man behind the cross is holding a gun.

jacopo-pontormo_seated-nude-with-raised-arm,negative,Looks like a lot is going sexually in this picture which doesnt bother me but their buttocks kind of are ugly.I feel discuss the way the bodies are bending looks very uncomfortable it is also not very flattering.A wrinkly old behind is very uncomfortable to look at.

paolo-veronese_boy-with-a-greyhound,positive,Men's clothing of this time period is very unusual and amusing.This painting makes me feel amusement because the dog looks like he is wanting to go chase something or move and the man is standing holding him back.Because the man in this portrait is wearing the most ridiculous feminine clothing while standing next to a very manly breed of dog.

paolo-veronese_mars-and-venus-united-by-love,negative,This painting makes me think a male painted it because the man is the only one with clothes on.The woman without clothes engenders thoughts of gratuitous nudity.It seems like the nudity of the woman is unneccessary and gratuitous.
paolo-veronese_moderation-1582,positive,"This is very interesting. it makes me wonder if the frame is simply painted that way to make an optical illusion, or if this is an actual frame made in this shape. either way, it's a nice effect. the deep blue of the sky compliments the coppery colors.The painting of the frame inside the picture is brilliant. the gold colors are perfect for it.The picture frame within the painting is a very effective addition and draws the eye."

andrei-cadere_six-round-wooden-bars-1975,positive,"Multi colored poles as artwork, at least they are different colors and patterns than the first one in the corner.It is amusing to try and figure out what the objects in the image are supposed to be, straws?Colorful but just looks like drumsticks.Looks like child toys."

ivan-generalic_landleben-1985,positive,"The use of overlapping and scale to gain perspective is an hilarious failure.Two giants set and enjoy some music next to some little people who are working.The change in size between the subjects is amusing, and the pop take on the colors is very pretty."

louis-vivin_les-invalides,positive,"I like the colors in the image, they're not too bright so it's not crazy, but at the same time it looks like a peaceful scene.The lines in the painting are symmetric which is satisfying.The depiction here of a building is pleasant and polite while being genuine."
lyonel-feininger_trumpeter-trompeter-1918,positive,Though the black lines are stark the character and toy(?) look playful and whimsical.The man seems to be much bigger than the city he is standing in.A giant standing over a village is really interesting.The man looks funny as he holds onto an object.I see a giant getting ready to play a brass instrument for a village below.It makes me think of a giant weight lifter.

marc-chagall_david-1956-1,negative,"This painting is very crude, and it is difficult to ascertain what the subject is doing. it does appear that he is holding a human head in his hand, which is rather gruesome. it looks like a child drew this picture.Holding a head of a decapitation is just sick.It is terrible. looks like he is holding another head but whoever drew this is 5 years old."
marc-chagall_eliezer-and-rebecca-1931,positive,"It is so crudely drawn that it makes me think my little niece has created artworks of way higher caliber than this, and i wonder who decides what is going to be expensive art.The monkey riding the camel is funny and ironic.Simple art style, and the faces of the subjects look funny."

marc-chagall_moses-with-the-burning-bush-4,positive,That angel is buff and on fire and the old man in green is so indifferent its great.They have such bright and distinct personalities through the colors chosen for the art.The simplicity of the sketches and the inexact application of color make it look like a rough draft..

maurice-prendergast_village-against-purple-mountain,positive,"This reminds me of a finger painting that my small children would bring home.Although this is probably a 6+ figure work of art, it feels amateurish to me like a fingerpainting from a 5 year old.The bright, yet dark fall colors used for the tree's and background give me warmth."
natalia-goncharova_linen,positive,"Villagers work pleasantly on textiles amid two wandering geese and an appealing sunrise.Such great vibrant color, i like how the white lines are being laid down, like theyre about to play a game.Beautiful colors, this painting express feet of working women's in my opinion.The setting is very picturesque with very comforting and warm colors.Three women spreading out clothes and two white ducks playing around.The women working on the tree and the garden makes me feel calm and relaxed."

pablo-picasso_a-bank-of-canal-1905,positive,"Its a bit overly simplistic and the colors aren't very appealing, but the painting also carries somewhat of a quaint atmosphere to it. it's as if these are just small-time people who know each other saying hello for the day.The three people chatting together seem to be enjoying each others company and conversation.The sketchy nature of this makes it feel very personal and the sepia/grey tonality makes me think of old fashioned photography.The simple painting of people greeting one another near an amsterdam canal is calming."
pavel-filonov_landscape-with-two-animals,positive,"The way the picture is drawn reminds me of current day cartoons.When you look closer things on the farm look too big or out of place.I'm amused by what i'm seeing , how the picture looks good made from charcoal."

albrecht-durer_the-harrowing-of-hell-or-christ-in-limbo-from-the-large-passion-1510,negative,"It looks like someone will be crucified in this image and that is a scary thought for that person.This looks like people are naked, and it would appear that there are very questionable things going on here. there are lions as well.It looks like all the people in the painting are suffering at least some.There seems to be a lot of pent up anguish in this artwork, for example, the sharp light coming from the man's head and the demonic creatures jeering from above.This pictures shows fear as it takes on others."
albrecht-durer_the-virgin-and-child-with-st-anne,positive,"The expression on the people's faces makes me amused.The woman on the left is wearing a garment around her head and chin and it accents her bright white eyes.The woman wearing the white has some really funny, buggy looking eyeballs and i cannot help but laugh when i look at her.The white head garment on the woman makes her look like she has a huge head and a tiny face."

hieronymus-bosch_the-garden-of-earthly-delights-4,positive,"Makes me think of futuristic sci-fi, which makes me wonder what the distant future will be like.It's hard to decipher what is depicted in this painting, however, it is a very stunning piece.The painting looks like a town is placed inside a globe.The world as depicted through a glass globe or a paperweight seems rather spectacular.This scene looks mystical since there are clouds of white hanging beneath the glass."

jan-van-hemessen_the-lamentation-of-christ,negative,"The sad nature of the peoples emotions reminds me of death.The vulnerability of the semi-naked man appears as if he is in pain or possibly dead due to the pain shown on the people's faces sitting around him.The pain of a mother,a friend and others when they are helpless and have to see their beloved in pain.This is one of the saddest single moments in religious mythology."
jean-fouquet_battle-of-jericho,positive,"The houses in the background are muted, but the people in the foreground are brightly covered and seem to be celebrating something with musical instruments.The worshippers appear to be transferring a symbol of enormous importance, like the holy of holies, on a hillside.The bright colors and the instruments give a sense of fanfare."

jean-fouquet_the-crucifixion-1460,negative,"Jesus and his two compatriots are all dying on crosses.The roman soldiers dispassionately observe the horrific suffering of jesus and others by crucifixion.The prisoners are being mistreated by the wealthy. the rich have gowns with beautiful colouring to depict class.Crucifixion art where royals seem to mistreat the poor or criminals. the colouring is bright and encouraging but the art shows a tragic sadness.I am greatly saddened by the story told in this painting which is also an extremely beautiful piece of art.Jesus and two others are on the cross suffering while people watch and do nothing.I feel sad for the men being murdered on the crosses in this image.This is very sad - the three men are being crucified to death and it looks like the men at the bottom are fighting about it. the woman in blue at the lower left is very sad, almost despondent. the tones of blue are calming but this is not a calm scene.It is a sad scene for the crucifixion of christ here. even for non-believers, it feels sad.I'm not sure what  this thing is people have with seeing a religious icon suffer.  it just seems odd to me.  i don't like seeing people in pain.I feel sadness because there are three people being crucified in the painting. the use of blue also creates a feeling of sorrow as well as the people who are visibly upset in the painting itself below the three crosses.That which is just is not always right.These men look like they are being tortured and it makes me upset.As a non religous person i dont really care about this but the act of crusifixtion is pretty sad.Jesus is dying at the center cross, and other men are being hung beside him.People being tortured on a cross while others look on is sad.Three people crucified on the cross as  people are cheering on  its depressing.Even though the colors are brilliant and upbeat and the crucified seem resigned, the subject matter is nonetheless sad and remorseful.This crucific scene makes me sad and happy about the outcome.It's sad how these people are watching others getting put to death.The subject matter of the painting, christ on the cross, makes me feel sad because most people don't understand what it means.The poor people mourn the men stuck on the crosses.This painting shows jesus and other religious on the cross surrounded by people. it gives out a feeling of sadness.This is a detailed picture of the crucifixion.This picture represents the crucifixition of our lord and savior jesus christ. remembering this event is sombering.The raised crosses emphasizes the crucified men's humiliation.This is a powerful scene with jesus christ in the middle and a sinner on either side with soldiers and citizens mocking them and shaking spears at them in judgment. i'm sad that jesus was being punished, though he was completely innocent.This picture makes me feel a multitude of things hope and fear, and a lot of sadness, its a lot rolled into one.Even if it is religious it is sad to see people tortured to death.Crucifixion was a horrible way to kill someone. i believe this is the crucifixion of jesus and that story always makes me sad."
joachim-patinir_landscape-with-the-flight-into-egypt-1516,positive,The woman taking care of her child in a meadow makes for a relaxing sight.There is a sense of lushness of the foliage of grass and trees that is draped by bright blue skies and ocean gives a feeling of balance.An idyllic countryside that only exists in dreams.The soft light and lush grass make it seem like a pleasant afternoon.

rogier-van-der-weyden_triptych-of-st-eloi,negative,"No one can do anything to save jesus from his impending death.The art for the masses to remind of constant suffering, death and doom.The bleak colors and the scene leave one filled with sadness and something lacking.There is a biblical feel to the image, it is bleak and filled with sadness."

victor-hugo_p-cherie-at-night,negative,The dark shadows are eerie and the image is undefinable so it makes me wonder what might be lurking in the darkness.The imagery is very dark and blurry so i can't tell exactly what is happening but it doesn't look good.Looks as if an abandoned watched tower is the only thing left to guard against the night.The dark and unclear strokes make this picture seem spokey.
