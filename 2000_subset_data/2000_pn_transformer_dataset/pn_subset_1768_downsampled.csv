hans-hofmann_the-bouquet-1959,negative,"The colors blend together to make a nasty brown color which makes me think of diarrhea.The mixing of the colors make a gross looking brown color.The mix of colors, and erratic way it is mixed together, makes me go yuck!The colors together are ugly. i hate this type of art. i don't see anything at all that makes any sense whatsoever, and i wouldn't want to stare at it too long because i find it ugly."

salvador-dali_arabs,negative,"It just looks like curdled milk; so gross and nauseating looking.The jumbled, twisted shapes of the picture do not depict anything clearly, but somewhat evoke the idea of rotten food or filth thanks to their putrid colors and shapes.Interesting texture but it looks like squeezed toothpaste noodles covered in mustard vomit."
salvador-dali_faciamus-hominem-genesis-1-26-1964,negative,"This person has some very dirty feet and perhaps some fungal issues.  he also appears to be missing an eye, not a very attractive painting.No one understands why he woud bring this back to everyone's memory, we want it gone.The large foot and man's face are gross looking.The figure in the middle reminds me of afterbirth.It looks like a big pile of poop and it makes me feel nauseous to look at it.The painting is nothing more than a blob and a foot making me feel disgusted."
salvador-dali_religious-scene-in-particles,negative,The subject on the left hand side looks like a demon emerging from the shadows.The tiny dark spots look like a ton of blood spatter.It feels like a scary clash between dark forces such as bats versus other birds in the white.

willem-de-kooning_the-wave,negative,"The painting looks like a group of random, uneven shapes with no meaning.A blue background with different spots and shapes in different colors, grey, mustard, black and red.The curved lines throughout the work contrast unpleasantly with the reddish orange square - the entire work is discordant and irksome, as if it were made by different artists who refused to communicate with each other."
willem-de-kooning_untitled-woman,negative,"Everything about the naked women is disgusting in this.The distortion of the figure takes away the human qualities and makes the figure look like a bag of meat. the use of red intensifies my repulsion and adds to the graphic nature of the image.This reminds me of the man known as sloth in the film se7en, one of the most grotesque scenes in movie history ever."
willem-de-kooning_woman-3,negative,"It looks dirty, like the bottom of a trash can that needs to be washed.I don't know what this is, it's not interesting in an abstract way, the color is lacking, and makes me think of a leftover meat sandwich in the fridge.It looks like unseasoned chicken meat. the top looks like a chicken's organs."
william-congdon_piazza-san-marco-no-5-1958,negative,"For some reason, this painting makes me think of a cemetery, or somewhere being caged in. it is very minimalist, so i could be getting the wrong impression. but the grey colors and lines leave me feeling like i am left alone in a lonely graveyard.This painting's white color is freezing cold. the greys are alomost suffocating.This looks lonely and unsafe because it seems like an isolated yard during winter and it has a wierd object in it that has cover over it. so it is a little creepy."
franz-kline_mahoning-1956,negative,"The intensity of black colors reminds me of the ruins after a fire.The hard and thick black strokes against white makes the strokes look even rougher and more aggressive. gives me a feeling of anger.The brushstrokes appear harsh and haphazard, and the dark smeared black evokes hostility."

aladar-korosfoi-kriesch_memory-1905,negative,I feel the sadness of the angel.The angel is crying.This painting makes me feel sad because it lacks color and does a very good job of portraying pain on the angel's face.Best brandy makes me feel sad for the angel who was being punished.
aubrey-beardsley_the-woman-in-the-moon-1894,negative,A large person is on their deathbed while people look on with aversion.The contradiction between the genitals and the person's face sounds disgusting to me.This photo makes me feel disgusted since there appears to be a man/woman with there genitalia showing and a weird face in the distance. it seems a bit gross and perverted for no apparent reason.
felix-vallotton_edgar-allan-poe-1895,negative,"The downturned eyebrows and the clasped hands looks like the man is worried. the ubiquitous black coloring signifies impending doom.A very stark black and white cartoonist depiction of poe, who reminds me of sadness and depression.Starkness of the black and white and the look on that man's face looks sorroful."
felix-vallotton_portrait-of-arthur-rimbaud-1898,negative,"The color black makes the man look depressed and it makes me sad.There is a dejected sense about her. maybe it is the seemingly pursed lips and the slightly squinted longing eyes.The black and white nature of the image, and the uneasy expression gives you a sense of gloom."

heorhiy-narbut_cover-for-the-book-the-russian-red-cross-1867-1917-1917,negative,This creates the impression of nazi or communist values.This image lacks character and memorable traits and looks more like a logo than a work of art.The image reminds me of posters for far-right political groups.

nicholas-roerich_the-last-angel-1912,negative,"The creature with the spear looks like an evil demon.A horrifying piece of what looks to be a religious symbol allowing a village to burn to the ground, perhaps as a punishment or a warning.The oranges and reds are vivid but the subject matter is disturbing and depicts destruction of a city, the angel has a terrible expression of hatred.It looks like the picture is set in hell or something.The fiery flames and billowing smoke indicate destruction to everyone in the village. the angelic figure is clothed in armor and is larger than life.The deep reds and oranges of the fire makes me feel the heat and the boldness of the angel of death (hell?) along with his angry glare invikes a deep dre and  fear.Angel holding spear surrounded by fire & burning city."

vittore-carpaccio_the-triumph-of-st-george-1502,negative,It looks like an animal is being killed in front of a group of people.The man is holding a sword over the animal.To me this painting shows a creature about to be slayed. the sword in the air about to murder this creature. it makes me angry that someone could do such a thing. i feel like this man needs the sword turned on him.
vittore-carpaccio_three-studies-of-a-cavalier-in-armor,negative,The solider looks as they are riding on a ghost of another soilder.Seeing this disembodied soldier is quite frightening. it looks as if somebody just cut his leg off.The look on the face in the top right looks demonic.The person is slowly losing pieces of their own identity.
abdullah-suriosubroto_menuju-danau,negative,It seems to me the man is lonely and lost in a jungle.The figure in the painting is dwarfed by the environment and seems to be isolated.The greenery and the shadows gives it a dark feeling.
antoine-blanchard_place-de-la-republique-2,negative,"Looming gray clouds signal the end of a bustling day.The sky is quite gloomy and rain appears to be approaching.The day appears to be uneventful, but maybe too uneventful.The sky is dark and gray and the people all appear to be in their own world."
arkhip-kuindzhi_a-birch-grove-1,negative,"The dark colors and scary appearances would not make me want to be here. the greens and blues are so dark they almost blend together.It has gotten late and now i fear being in this dark forest, must go where it is safe.The forest is dark and quiet and could be hiding almost anything.It's getting dark in the creepy forest, what is hiding behind those trees?"
arkhip-kuindzhi_forest-glade-fog,negative,This image is dark and the shadows in the distance seem to indicate a storm or wind.  the image seems to convey darkness and motion and an element of fear seems to be portrayed.The dark and splattered brush strokes give me a sense of uneasiness and fear.I feel the fear of darkness in the painting. the fear walking thru and see nothing but darkness.
arkhip-kuindzhi_moonlight-in-a-forest-winter,negative,"Dark lonely place. i am not sure if the light is reflecting on snow or this is just a dark place. makes me feel fear.The dark menacing clouds are looming over everything.The overhanging tree on the upper right side has a very sinister feel to it.Sort of a scary setting, and the head-shaped projection in the background makes it feel like something is going to happen."
auguste-rodin_camille-claudel-1884,negative,"Silver metalic bust evokes images of a sad teenage in deep thought.The bust looks like a child that is very despondent.A fallen soldier when he was younger.  that was before the battle when we were all together.The figure seems beaten and unhappy, wondering when it will end."
camille-pissarro_garden-of-the-louvre-snow-effect-1899,negative,"Either the city is dirty or the painting is and needs to be cleaned.It looks like a deserted city. it has a gloomy feeling.The colors are drab and dark, making this feel cold and wet.The colors of the sky make the painting look gloomy and barren.It looks like an abandoned city. the yellow colors give the image a sad feeling."
claude-monet_study-of-rocks,negative,I feel slightly disgusted by this as it looks like a skin disease or a close up of some prehistoric animal.The rocking outcropping reminds me of warts on a human face.Though i love mountains and rolling hillsides the angle of this mountain side is just weird.
cornelis-vreedenburgh_view-on-the-ij-in-amsterdam,negative,"The dreary colors and lack of attention to detail of the boats makes it look that this is a dying community.A large ship is getting ready to sail off to sea for a long voyage.The openness of the composition, the huge sea, and the fact it is a port of some kind where people likely sailed off to never be seen again - makes me feel sad."
edgar-degas_after-the-bath-6,negative,"There's something about this figure that seems almost not human, like it has fur rather than skin, and its crawling towards the person seated.The person in the picture appears naked and affraid.I can't tell what this is about, but it feels almost beastily."
edgar-degas_study-for-the-medieval-war-scene-1865-1,negative,"The man doesn't seem to be confident sharing his genitals with the audience.The woman's face indicates pain, and her arm is raised unnaturally up and to the side of her head.For some reason i think this woman must be having body image issues. she's gorgeous, though. i just want to hug her.The person looks like she is in physical pain and distress with her head bowed."
edgar-degas_the-milliner,negative,"This makes me feel confused. i'm not sure what the man in the picture is doing, if the woman in the background is a sculpture or another figure. i believe he might be a hatter working on a hat, but i can't be sure. further, the way his face seems oddly detailed and realistic compared to the sketched lines of everything else is a bit scary.The man's grey face gives off a feeling of immenent death.The face looks almost realistic while everything else does not; that and the odd, dark colors makes this a bit creepy looking."
edouard-manet_study-for-the-execution-of-emperor-maximilian-1867,negative,The dark colors and smoking guns imply a firing squad. this image of gunfire convey's death.This is making me feel alone and wants to hide in some safe place.It looks like the men are shooting in the middle of a battle.

gustave-caillebotte_calf-head-and-ox-tongue,negative,"A head hanging on a hook is always a bit jarring to see.A dead animal's head hangs from a hook so that the head can bleed out.The goats head is hanging by its nostrils and there is some type of organ next to it.I don't know what this is but i do know that i would never eat it or touch it, either."
guy-rose_carmel-shore-1919-1,negative,"The sand looks like it's being choked by dirt and debris.This image is like a lonely deserted island with a gloomy atmosphere.The image is cold and unfeeling, it is a bit bland."

joaquã­n-sorolla_boy-with-a-ball-1887,negative,I feel uncomfortable having to witness the naked boy.The subject of the painting looks very young to be shown nude.The nude body and child's pose are not conducive to good feelings.

nicolae-tonitza_seine-at-courbevoie-1910,negative,"The water looks really dull, as though it's been polluted.The colors are dull and morose, so the painting seems sad.Give a feeling of a bad storm approaching.The water bears a dreary tone, and is devoid of human life."
paul-cezanne_guillaumin-with-the-hanged-man-1873,negative,"I loathe  the image of what looks like a hanging in the top left corner.The subject in the painting looks devilish.The man looks lazy since he's just sitting down, doing nothing."

pierre-auguste-renoir_gabrielle-holding-a-mirror-with-a-portrait-of-coco-1905,negative,The look on the girls face makes her look as though she is not happy with her reflection in the mirror.It feels a little sad to see someone looking in the mirror and not being happy. her expression looks slightly sad and it's a little depressing.Shes left with nothing but a necklace from the man she loves.
pierre-auguste-renoir_girl-with-a-pink-ribbon,negative,This girl had no intention of being the object of a painting and that's the expression on her face.The picture elicits sadness due to it's dark undertones and some contentment at the same time.The little girl in the portrait looks kind of sad it makes me wonder what is wrong. her eyes have a sadness behind them.Are you in a bad mood because i'm here.This little girl looks like she's about to burst into tears.there is a lot of tension in her face.
pierre-auguste-renoir_head-of-a-woman-in-red,negative,"The use of reds and the subject's eyes looking downward makes me feel sad, it's as if she's sad herself.The woman's downbeat expression and the hues used to frame her surroundings that makes this image one that evokes a sad state of affairs.The woman is sad due to not getting what she wants out of life."
pierre-auguste-renoir_still-life-with-fish,negative,Why would i want to see a painting of fish that has yet to be cleaned.The red on the fish looks like blood.The fish look so bloody and red. one of the fish on the right is strangely bent like someone broke its body. fish have bone structure and shouldn't be that flexible.
theophrastos-triantafyllidis_women-in-the-royal-garden-1937,negative,"The colors of the painting are drab and drab and the people are faceless.The colors of the background and woman remind me of a sad time.It's very snowy on the ground, but the women still feel pressured to wear high heels."
umberto-boccioni_farmers-at-work-risaiole-1908,negative,The pictures are not not well clear and feary.These women seem to have a lot of ground to cover to finish the work in this field.While the colors are bright the red around the people looks like they are bleeding from the hard work they are doing.
zinaida-serebriakova_winter-in-the-royal-village-upper-bath-1912,negative,"The barren landscape and the empty trees make it seem so stark and lonely.The sculpture seems too stiff, as if it's been frozen in the snow.The lone statue surrounded by trees makes for a lonely sight.The house feels quite lonely in in the far away reaches of this work. the statue appears to be the only thing keeping the area company."

el-greco_christ-carrying-the-cross,negative,Its a picture showing suffering.Picture of jesus wearing a thorny crown.How can a guy that apparently brings the world so much joy be so sad himself?
el-greco_laocoon,negative,This is really strange to me. i think its religious on some level perhaps of the fallen ones.The skin tones are terrifying and very unsettling to look at.The snakes and dark background.
el-greco_st-francis-and-brother-rufus-1606,negative,There is a use of colors that arouse a sensation in which the subjects are devoid of real meaning.There is a very grim like quality to the image and the subjects within it.The painting shows characters as very sad.

el-greco_the-dream-of-philip-ii-1579,negative,"There is fear when looking at this as if someone is coming out of the sky to judge those below.The image is powerful and shows a strong sense of dread in the world it portrays.This has burning colors with an obvious distinction of those above and those below who are begging looking desperately upward, made with a clashing business across the image."
giorgio-vasari_the-deposition,negative,"The man has been injured, possibly mortally, and it looks like he's being cradled by a mother-figure.This photo makes me feel sad. the image depicted here shows people who may not be happy or be their best.Because the young man appears to be deceased and everyone is mourning him.It appears that the person being held is sick or dying.He looks like he is dying and they seem worried."
jacopo-pontormo_seated-nude-with-raised-arm,negative,Looks like a lot is going sexually in this picture which doesnt bother me but their buttocks kind of are ugly.I feel discuss the way the bodies are bending looks very uncomfortable it is also not very flattering.A wrinkly old behind is very uncomfortable to look at.
paolo-veronese_jesus-healing-the-servant-of-a-centurion,negative,"The blackened skies, the horse tilting his head, and the old man pleading indicate that this is a worrisome scene.The man being held by the two men seems scared to approach the man with outstretched arms.The dark black sky and soldiers with spears is scary and threatening."
paolo-veronese_mars-and-venus-united-by-love,negative,This painting makes me think a male painted it because the man is the only one with clothes on.The woman without clothes engenders thoughts of gratuitous nudity.It seems like the nudity of the woman is unneccessary and gratuitous.
paolo-veronese_the-triumph-of-mordecai-1556,negative,"The horses look scared, maybe becuase of the battle to come?The painting is busy with war-like action, which makes me fearful for the safety of everyone involved.This painting is war like and looks like people are fighting."
tintoretto_the-battle-of-zara,negative,"This looks like a war scene where many men are being killed or hurt.The painting shows the worst effects war has on populations.A gruesome battle with weapons which is painted in black and white, making it even more sad. you can see dead bodies lying there, and people and horses just about to get stabbed."
tintoretto_the-conversion-of-saul,negative,The dark colors and the crowded painting look a bit scary.It looks like a battle scene where no one is winning and everyone is falling.The scene is chaotic and the people and animals appear to be confused and injured.
titian_tarquin-and-lucretia-1576,negative,I can see the fear in this picture with the womans face and the knife being held by the man.This appears to be a woman being violated in the worst way.The man looks like he is trying to attack the woman.
agnes-martin_untitled-1994,negative,"The sparseness of it is a little depressing.Not sure why it makes me feel sad when i see it just looks blah.Blankness, but also texture in the sameness."
brice-marden_nebraska-1966,negative,"Sad because its so basic.Sadness, it's just a dull color blue.  it's kind of a sad color, it reminds me of the hospital.Sad.  very sad.  nothingness.  blue.It's gray, nothing but a solid square of gray, like one little snapshot of the side of a navy ship."

piero-manzoni_achrome-1959-2,negative,It makes me angry that someone thought this could be art.This isn't even artwork when you look at it and that makes me upset.I thought this was a napkin at first look. what is this part of wall paper? this is not good at all.
yves-klein_untitled-blue-monochrome-1957-2,negative,"This is considered art work and it is so much nothingness it makes me angry.I like a picture that says something and this shows nothing.It is just a blue square.  i don't like paintings that don't have some sort of scene being portrayed in them.  or, at least, i would like a combination of different colors."

fernando-botero_woman,negative,This made me sad because she seems like a child and yet they have her painted in poor taste and her face looks bloated more then the rest of her making me think she might be ill as well.The girl's expression is sad and she shouldn't be nude.This naked child looks confused and her features are embellished for comedic effect. sad.
grã©goire-michonze_figures,negative,One woman with bulging eyes is fainting while an old lady is clutching her heart in distress.Everyone in the painting seems to be suffering and need help.The men in brown and salmon look like they are attaxking the others!These people look like they are in the aftermath of a tragedy.
marc-chagall_a-man-with-thora-1975,negative,"The dark colors and shadows make the man look like he is bothering the woman and child.Dark and brooding, and the expressions on the faces of the woman and child suggest the man is a dirtbag.The dark, distorted figures and heavy use of blacks look foreboding."
marc-chagall_david-1956-1,negative,"This painting is very crude, and it is difficult to ascertain what the subject is doing. it does appear that he is holding a human head in his hand, which is rather gruesome. it looks like a child drew this picture.Holding a head of a decapitation is just sick.It is terrible. looks like he is holding another head but whoever drew this is 5 years old."

marc-chagall_moses-receiving-the-tablets-of-law,negative,"This man is trying to reach out from beyond the grave to warn others about his mistakes.The black and white is very striking but the main figure in this is a little scary.The figure on the left looks to be a terrifying ruler, and the darkened shadows further amplify this.It looks like demons flying towards gravestones or souls."
marc-chagall_moses-spreads-death-among-the-egyptians-1931,negative,"Appears to be a scene of death and destruction with the main person being of jewish origin reaching his hands towrd god in pleading.I feel like he is raising his hands in despair for something that he and his need.  i feel for him.Reminds me of a zombie trying to capture me,scary."

edward-hopper_study-of-a-seated-woman,negative,"She just looks so sad and forlorn.The woman looks to be sad.I feel sad for the woman in this picture, as she looks angry.  it's possible she's angry about how ugly her dress is. the diagonal lines also depict anger to me."
albrecht-durer_arm-of-lucretia,negative,"The heavy black shading feels ominous. the angle of the blame suggests self-harm.This makes me think the artist was angry at someone, possibly all o humanity.The person is holding a weapon and looks like he is going to either hurt himself or someone else."
albrecht-durer_christ-being-nailed-to-the-cross-1511,negative,Feels sad because this looks like bible story about crucified jesus.Sad that my lord and savior is being nailed to a cross.The crucifixion scene makes me feel sad because i think it is a tragedy.
albrecht-durer_dead-bluebird-1512,negative,"The poor bird looks dead, which makes me feel sad.The bird is beautiful but there is so much sadness in the fact that it is dead.The bird appears to be dead and there's nothing else in the painting as if it's purely trying to illustrate death. this makes me sad."

albrecht-durer_the-dresden-altarpiece-central-panel-1496,negative,"The muted colors make this art feel very solemn. the subject matter is also sad feeling. it appears as though she is praying over a sick baby.The baby has the head of a man and its mother is already praying for the baby's health.The somber colors (maybe an underpainting?) and worried look on the woman's face make me feel that something is wrong. is the baby dead? the angels are bringing a crown, but they look sinister to me.i don't trust them."
albrecht-durer_the-harrowing-of-hell-or-christ-in-limbo-from-the-large-passion-1510,negative,"It looks like someone will be crucified in this image and that is a scary thought for that person.This looks like people are naked, and it would appear that there are very questionable things going on here. there are lions as well.It looks like all the people in the painting are suffering at least some.There seems to be a lot of pent up anguish in this artwork, for example, the sharp light coming from the man's head and the demonic creatures jeering from above.This pictures shows fear as it takes on others."
dirk-bouts_martyrdom-of-st-erasmus-central-panel,negative,"This man has a heavy red gash in his stomach, so he will soon bleed to death.The juxtaposition of torture, the idle cruelty of the man watching it, and the background of an ideal beautiful landscape. the rich clothing and posture of the main standing figure reinforce the impression.There is some kind of torture occurring here it seems. they are doing something to the man's body that might hurt him."
dirk-bouts_the-capture-of-christ,negative,The sky is dark and cloudy and the man in the foreground looks frightened that he will be struck with something.I can't tell what people are pushing him toward in that makes me anxious.Off to battle and coming back from battle mourning jesus and soldiers.There are many weapons being held by the men and it looks as if the man in the red cloak is about to strike the man in yellow who looks afraid.
hans-baldung_hercules-and-antaeus-1531,negative,The man appears like he is bent on harming the man quite terribly.The way the man in the mask is holding the other man looks like a scene in a horror movie. it's very disturbing.The appearance of what is transpiring appears violent and almost rape-like.
jan-van-hemessen_the-lamentation-of-christ,negative,"The sad nature of the peoples emotions reminds me of death.The vulnerability of the semi-naked man appears as if he is in pain or possibly dead due to the pain shown on the people's faces sitting around him.The pain of a mother,a friend and others when they are helpless and have to see their beloved in pain.This is one of the saddest single moments in religious mythology."
jean-fouquet_the-crucifixion-1460,negative,"Jesus and his two compatriots are all dying on crosses.The roman soldiers dispassionately observe the horrific suffering of jesus and others by crucifixion.The prisoners are being mistreated by the wealthy. the rich have gowns with beautiful colouring to depict class.Crucifixion art where royals seem to mistreat the poor or criminals. the colouring is bright and encouraging but the art shows a tragic sadness.I am greatly saddened by the story told in this painting which is also an extremely beautiful piece of art.Jesus and two others are on the cross suffering while people watch and do nothing.I feel sad for the men being murdered on the crosses in this image.This is very sad - the three men are being crucified to death and it looks like the men at the bottom are fighting about it. the woman in blue at the lower left is very sad, almost despondent. the tones of blue are calming but this is not a calm scene.It is a sad scene for the crucifixion of christ here. even for non-believers, it feels sad.I'm not sure what  this thing is people have with seeing a religious icon suffer.  it just seems odd to me.  i don't like seeing people in pain.I feel sadness because there are three people being crucified in the painting. the use of blue also creates a feeling of sorrow as well as the people who are visibly upset in the painting itself below the three crosses.That which is just is not always right.These men look like they are being tortured and it makes me upset.As a non religous person i dont really care about this but the act of crusifixtion is pretty sad.Jesus is dying at the center cross, and other men are being hung beside him.People being tortured on a cross while others look on is sad.Three people crucified on the cross as  people are cheering on  its depressing.Even though the colors are brilliant and upbeat and the crucified seem resigned, the subject matter is nonetheless sad and remorseful.This crucific scene makes me sad and happy about the outcome.It's sad how these people are watching others getting put to death.The subject matter of the painting, christ on the cross, makes me feel sad because most people don't understand what it means.The poor people mourn the men stuck on the crosses.This painting shows jesus and other religious on the cross surrounded by people. it gives out a feeling of sadness.This is a detailed picture of the crucifixion.This picture represents the crucifixition of our lord and savior jesus christ. remembering this event is sombering.The raised crosses emphasizes the crucified men's humiliation.This is a powerful scene with jesus christ in the middle and a sinner on either side with soldiers and citizens mocking them and shaking spears at them in judgment. i'm sad that jesus was being punished, though he was completely innocent.This picture makes me feel a multitude of things hope and fear, and a lot of sadness, its a lot rolled into one.Even if it is religious it is sad to see people tortured to death.Crucifixion was a horrible way to kill someone. i believe this is the crucifixion of jesus and that story always makes me sad."
lucas-cranach-the-elder_portrait-of-geiler-von-kaiserberg,negative,Something about his face and black cloak seems dastardly.The dark colors and the man's facial features give this work a fearsome feel.I am threatened by the sinister look on the man's face.
lucas-cranach-the-elder_salome-with-the-head-of-st-john-the-baptist,negative,The head on the plate makes me feel disturbed.This proper looking woman looks please to deliver a man's head on the platter.A woman with curly hair holds a platter of a cut off head.The man's head is quite terrifying as it lays on the platter.
rogier-van-der-weyden_entombment-of-christ-1450,negative,"The figure that looks like jesus looks sick, frail, weak, or dead.It portrays the burial of jesus christ after he was crucified on the cross.The body of jesus abd the facial expression of the figures around him showed a great sense of sadness.All parties mournfully crowd around their beloved deceased."
rogier-van-der-weyden_triptych-of-st-eloi,negative,"No one can do anything to save jesus from his impending death.The art for the masses to remind of constant suffering, death and doom.The bleak colors and the scene leave one filled with sadness and something lacking.There is a biblical feel to the image, it is bleak and filled with sadness."
georges-lemmen_the-two-sisters-1894,negative,This photo makes me feel sad because both of the girls faces are sad and look upset.I feel sad for these girls made to dress so rediculously for this moment.Both of the girls in the picture look sad.
andy-warhol_mao-5,negative,"This made me think it was a person who has done bad things. the way the face is red makes me think that he is meant to be viewed as an angry human.Communism's bad.It's mao zedong, plus it looks like he has herpes on his face."

jacek-malczewski_death-of-ellenai,negative,"The man kissing the sleeping woman's foot is disturbing.Gross. the earliest expression of a foot fetish? to each their own, i suppose but not for me.The positioning of the perspective make the affections appear unwanted and unsolicited.Woman appears dead. she has dirty clothing and body, yet the man is sucking her toes."
james-tissot_miriam-shut-out-from-the-camp,negative,The painting makes us feel sad as we notice the barefooted homeless person sitting in the doorway.Darkness and shadows make the person look sad or lost.The shading of the photo depicts the struggle of the individual in the photo.This painting makes me sad because the woman is barefoot and looks to be homeless.She looks very hot and un comftable sitting there.
james-tissot_the-ark-passes-over-the-jordan,negative,This death scene painted in black and white is sad.The cplors are black and white and the people look like they are carrying a coffin.Those people look sad and burdened. it does not look like their lives are enjoyable.The way these women are carrying this object motionless and emotionless bring a sadness to this piece.

koloman-moser_pieta,negative,"Very realistic details in the hand covering the grieving face. the hair on the deceased man could have been more detailed, adding depth and emotion to this piece. the neck and collarbone areas look very strange, but it portrayed exceptionally if you believe this is jesus, who was crucified. the details would be congruent with someone who died on a cross.  the mishapen appearance of the muscles holding the arms in that position for so long, until death.Looks like a man crying over a dead guy on the table. this makes me feel so sad. why would someone want this painting.The man lying down is probably dead, being mourned by someone who loved him.The woman's hand on her face really evokes sadness and grief over the situation."

mikalojus-ciurlionis_consert-1904,negative,The city looks very scary as if it is welcomed by an evil entity.The thing on top of the painting looks like a ghost with their mouth wide open.It looks like an angry face in the grey getting ready to destroy something.That looks like a face in the center with its mouth open and it's creeping me out.This painting gives me fear looks like a tomb to suck up the living.A ghostly feeling of terror and fire that is coming out of  a tomb stone.

nicholas-roerich_mongolian-rider-1931,negative,"This man seems to be lonely rinding on his horse.What a beautifully simple, yet complex piece of art. a dark horse and person upon it seem to be bowing their heads in sadness. what has occured for man and beast to get them to this place. a sense of sadness filled me immediately when seeing this art.Both horse and rider appear forlorn and exhausted on a barren hillside."
odilon-redon_angel-executions,negative,"The human head on a platter and the weird no leg body is disturbing.Clearly putting another mans head on a plate is disgusting, unless there is a backstory i need to know.The robotic-like man degrades another man's severed head by displaying it on a food platter."

victor-hugo_p-cherie-at-night,negative,The dark shadows are eerie and the image is undefinable so it makes me wonder what might be lurking in the darkness.The imagery is very dark and blurry so i can't tell exactly what is happening but it doesn't look good.Looks as if an abandoned watched tower is the only thing left to guard against the night.The dark and unclear strokes make this picture seem spokey.
victor-hugo_planet-1866,negative,There appears to be a frightening eye-like monster in the shadows.It seems that the ball is being sucked into the darkness.The dark cloud and mysterious round shape that cannot quite be made out make me feel very apprehensive.
